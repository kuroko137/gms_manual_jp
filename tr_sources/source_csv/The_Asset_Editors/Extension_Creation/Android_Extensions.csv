"Android_Extensions.htm+html.body.p:87-3","To create an extension for Android you have to do it in two parts. The first part would be to add the extension itself, along with the required files etc... and the second is to create the functions and macros/constants that the extension requires. The functions and constants are added using <strong>placeholder </strong>files to group them together, so you'd add a placeholder and then define the functions and macros as explained in the section above. To add the rest of the files though you need to first tick the <em>Android </em>check-box in the <strong>Additional Features</strong> section of the editor:","","URL_EN : https://manual.yoyogames.com/index.htm#t=The_Asset_Editors%2FExtension_Creation%2FAndroid_Extensions.htm \n\nURL_JP : https://kuroko137.github.io/gms_manual_jp/index.htm#t=The_Asset_Editors%2FExtension_Creation%2FAndroid_Extensions.htm"
