"Paths.htm+html.body.p:87-3","At some point while creating your games you may need one of your instances to follow a path through a level. Now, this can be done in code by simply creating an array of positions within the room and then having an instance move between them, but that can be a chore to set up and is difficult to change, test and adapt for different instances. For this reason GameMaker Studio 2 has path resources and a dedicated path editor.","","URL_EN : https://manual.yoyogames.com/index.htm#t=The_Asset_Editors%2FPaths.htm \n\nURL_JP : https://kuroko137.github.io/gms_manual_jp/index.htm#t=The_Asset_Editors%2FPaths.htm"
"Paths.htm+html.body.p:90-3","The basic idea is rather simple - you define a path by drawing it in the path editor, then you can place an action (or code) in the creation event of an object to tell the instance to follow that particular path. You can also set the speed to follow the path and a number of other actions relating to the position and orientation of the path within the room. When you first create a path resource the path editor window will open with the following options:","","URL_EN : https://manual.yoyogames.com/index.htm#t=The_Asset_Editors%2FPaths.htm \n\nURL_JP : https://kuroko137.github.io/gms_manual_jp/index.htm#t=The_Asset_Editors%2FPaths.htm"

"Paths.htm+html.body.div.p:95-5","As with all resources in GameMaker Studio 2 you should give your new path a unique name as this is what will be used to identify it throughout the game you are making, and a good system that a lot of people use is to prefix (or suffix) the resource for easy recognition in code or actions (eg: <span class=""inline"">path_Enemy_1</span> or <span class=""inline"">PowerUp_path</span>).","","URL_EN : https://manual.yoyogames.com/index.htm#t=The_Asset_Editors%2FPaths.htm \n\nURL_JP : https://kuroko137.github.io/gms_manual_jp/index.htm#t=The_Asset_Editors%2FPaths.htm"
"Paths.htm+html.body.div.p:97-5","Once you have named the path, you can start to define it by placing points in the main editor on the right, with each point being added to the list here along with its position and speed. The speed value for path points is defined by a percentage of the speed at which you make the instance move along the path (default is 100%). So if you start an instance at a speed of 2 (2 pixels per step) along a path and then one of the path points has a speed value of 50%, the instance will reduce speed as it approaches this points to a speed of 1 (50% of the path speed). Equally, you can set the speed to 150% and the instance will accelerate as it reaches the point. In this way you can create some nice dynamic looking movement without any code whatsoever.","","URL_EN : https://manual.yoyogames.com/index.htm#t=The_Asset_Editors%2FPaths.htm \n\nURL_JP : https://kuroko137.github.io/gms_manual_jp/index.htm#t=The_Asset_Editors%2FPaths.htm"

"Paths.htm+html.body.div.p:104-5","You can also specify the connection kind for the whole path and whether the path should be closed or not (a closed path will connect the last point on the path with the first). The connection kind can be either <strong>straight line</strong>, or <strong>smooth </strong>where a straight line connect simply connects the points of a path in a linear basis, with angular changes at each point, while a smooth connection will create a much softer path that may not pass directly through any of the points, but rather take an approximate line, creating nice curves using <a class=""tooltip"" title=""TITLE_KEY::smooth_interpolation"">smooth interpolation</a>. You can also specify the precision for the curves (default is 4) which can be from 1 to 8 with 8 being the smoothest.
