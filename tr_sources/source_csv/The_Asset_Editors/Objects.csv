"Objects.htm+html.body.p:87-3","Objects are the resource that we use to control aspects of a game and to do specific things. Most of the time they have a sprite associated with them so that you see them in the game rooms, but sometimes they are used as a ""behind the scenes"" controller to do things related to the user or for timing, etc... They can be given behaviours and they can react to certain events as well as to each other, and most of the things you see in a game are based on objects and their interactions. Now, we say ""based on"" because you don't actually place objects directly into the game rooms, but rather you place <strong>instances</strong> of these objects which are basically copies (or clones if you prefer) of the object resource. This is a very important thing to remember as instances and objects <em>are not the same thing</em> and each have their own set of functions that can affect them.","","URL_EN : https://manual.yoyogames.com/index.htm#t=The_Asset_Editors%2FObjects.htm \n\nURL_JP : https://kuroko137.github.io/gms_manual_jp/index.htm#t=The_Asset_Editors%2FObjects.htm"
"Objects.htm+html.body.p:91-3","To clarify this, think of a game made with GameMaker Studio 2. All the characters, monsters, balls, walls, etc... are all objects you create in the <a href=""../Introduction/The_Asset_Browser.htm"">Asset Browser</a>. You then drag the <em>object </em>into a room in the <a href=""Rooms.htm"">Room Editor</a> to create an <em>instance </em>copied from the basic object template. The instance in the room can then be changed in the editor itself or through code, so that it can be scaled, or coloured, or have other details modified from the ""base"" object. So when we talk about something affecting or changing an <strong>instance</strong>, we mean it affects that <em>one particular copy of an object in a room</em>. Only that single instance is being affected while all the rest are not. But, when we talk about affecting or changing an <strong>object</strong>, we mean that we are modifying the object in the Asset Browser and anything we do to it will be reflected in all the instances created from that point on too. So, the object is the template for the instance, and the instance is what we place in a room to make our game.","","URL_EN : https://manual.yoyogames.com/index.htm#t=The_Asset_Editors%2FObjects.htm \n\nURL_JP : https://kuroko137.github.io/gms_manual_jp/index.htm#t=The_Asset_Editors%2FObjects.htm"

This means that if you place a persistent object in one room, it will still be available in all subsequent rooms and will continue to perform any actions assigned to the events in its object properties, <em>except </em>the <strong>Create Event</strong>, which is only fired <em>once </em>when it is created initially and not when you change to a new room. This is handy for when you have, for example, a main character that moves from room to room and you want to maintain the variables within the instance the same, but you should take great care to create and destroy persistent objects correctly as you can easily get errors creeping into your project by mistake.","","URL_EN : https://manual.yoyogames.com/index.htm#t=The_Asset_Editors%2FObjects.htm \n\nURL_JP : https://kuroko137.github.io/gms_manual_jp/index.htm#t=The_Asset_Editors%2FObjects.htm"
