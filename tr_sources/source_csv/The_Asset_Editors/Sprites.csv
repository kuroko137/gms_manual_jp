"Sprites.htm+html.body.div.p:196-5","It's important to note that the Frame Speed settings will not only affect the playback of the animation in the preview window, but <strong>will also govern how the sprite is animated in your games</strong>.

So, for example, if you set the sprite to use 10 ""frames per second"" and then set the <span class=""inline"">image_speed</span> to 0.5, the game will draw the sprite at half speed - 5 frames per second. Conversely, if we set the <span class=""inline"">image_speed</span> for the same sprite to 2, in the game it will be drawn animated twice as fast - 20 frames per second.
