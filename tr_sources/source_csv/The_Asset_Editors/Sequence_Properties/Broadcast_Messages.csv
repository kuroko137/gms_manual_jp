These messages are simple strings that are added to specific frames along the animation timeline, and when that point in the timeline is reached, then the string will be broadcast out to all instances that listen for it. Any instance that has a <a href=""../Object_Properties/Other_Events.htm"">Broadcast Message Event</a> (found in the ""<strong>Other</strong>"" event category) will receive the message string when it is reached in the timeline, at which point it's up to you to have some code that will parse it and react accordingly. Note too that sequences can also listen for broadcast messages, but this requires you to first set up the listener method using code (see the GML section on <a href=""../../GameMaker_Language/GML_Reference/Asset_Management/Sequences/Sequence_Events_Moments_Broadcast.htm"">Sequence Events And Moments</a> for more information).","","URL_EN : https://manual.yoyogames.com/index.htm#t=The_Asset_Editors%2FSequence_Properties%2FBroadcast_Messages.htm \n\nURL_JP : https://kuroko137.github.io/gms_manual_jp/index.htm#t=The_Asset_Editors%2FSequence_Properties%2FBroadcast_Messages.htm"
