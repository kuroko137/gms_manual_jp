Here you can <em>add</em>, <em>delete </em>and <em>rename </em><strong>Texture Groups</strong>. GameMaker Studio 2 permits you to assign each of the graphics assets (sprites, tilesets, and fonts) to different texture groups to try and optimise the number of texture swaps that the hardware does at any given time in your game. For that to work, you need to define the necessary texture groups from this window, and then go through each of the appropriate asset types and select the group you wish it to belong to from the drop down menu. Alternatively you can add assets to a texture group via the right mouse button <img_tag=RMB_Icon:0> menu in the <a href=""../Introduction/The_Asset_Browser.htm"">Asset Browser</a>. You can select one or more assets (or an entire asset group folder) and then use the RMB menu to add the assets to any group, as shown below for tilesets:","","URL_EN : https://manual.yoyogames.com/index.htm#t=Settings%2FTexture_Groups.htm \n\nURL_JP : https://kuroko137.github.io/gms_manual_jp/index.htm#t=Settings%2FTexture_Groups.htm"

This can be useful, especially when dealing with universal apps, as it allows you to put specific resources like fonts in a group of its own to be used when the app is run on a specific device. For example, fonts can look great on a retina display, but when they are scaled down to draw on a normal display they can look terrible so you can assign them to a special non-scaling group - if developing for the iPhone, you may wish to have this checked, as apps have been rejected due to the images being blurred by texture scaling.

However, if, for example, you are using the image as a non-repeating texture for primitives or anything similar, this means that the UV coordinates for texture mapping are not going to be correctly represented. In these cases you can un-flag this option and the sprite will be added to the texture page ""as is"", maintaining any transparencies that it may have around the edges. This is flagged as <em>on </em>by default.","","URL_EN : https://manual.yoyogames.com/index.htm#t=Settings%2FTexture_Groups.htm \n\nURL_JP : https://kuroko137.github.io/gms_manual_jp/index.htm#t=Settings%2FTexture_Groups.htm"
"Texture_Groups.htm+html.body.ul.li:117-5","<strong>Generate Mipmaps</strong> - Flagging this option (it is off by default) will tell GameMaker Studio 2 that the original texture page is to be scaled and filtered into multiple resolutions within the texture file. This is normally <em>off</em>, but if you are using cameras to zoom in or out on large areas of the game room, or you are working with a 3D game, then you may want to enable this and then use the <a href=""../GameMaker_Language/GML_Reference/Drawing/Mipmapping/Mipmapping.htm"">Mipmapping Functions</a> to adjust how the game deals with the different mipmap levels. When you flag this check box the ""Border Size"" value will be set to 8 (if it was set to less than 8 originally). This is because, when using mipmaps, you need larger borders between images on the texture pages otherwise they start bleeding together at higher mip levels. The default value of 8 will allow the image to be reduced to about an eighth of its original size before the sub-images start bleeding together, but you can change this to any value that is required to suit your needs. Note that if you are using the ""<strong>Separate Texture Page</strong>"" option for sprites, then you do not need to go through each texture here and flag it to generate mipmaps, but instead you can go to the <a href=""Game_Options.htm"">General Game Options</a> and flag the option ""<strong>Generate mipmaps for separate texture pages</strong>"".","","URL_EN : https://manual.yoyogames.com/index.htm#t=Settings%2FTexture_Groups.htm \n\nURL_JP : https://kuroko137.github.io/gms_manual_jp/index.htm#t=Settings%2FTexture_Groups.htm"

The default is 2 pixels, but in extreme cases where you are zooming the view in or out a great deal then you may need to increase this value. Note that the <a href=""../The_Asset_Editors/Tile_Sets.htm"">Tile Set Editor</a> has an option to set the output border for tiles (and also provides an explanation of why this is necessary), and this is separate to the border setting here - basically, tiles are generated with an output border for each tile on a temporary texture, and this is then added to the texture page with the border given here around the outside edge. Also note that enabling Mipmaps will automatically set the default border size for the texture page to 8 to help prevent ""bleeding"" between textures at higher mip levels, but this can be changed.","","URL_EN : https://manual.yoyogames.com/index.htm#t=Settings%2FTexture_Groups.htm \n\nURL_JP : https://kuroko137.github.io/gms_manual_jp/index.htm#t=Settings%2FTexture_Groups.htm"

""Child"" groups will inherit any changes made to the parent texture group and are primarily for resource management when working with cross platform games. A texture group with a parent is still a texture group in its own right and will generate texture pages the same as any other group, but assigning them a parent allows you to exclude large chunks for different platforms. For example, you can add a whole load of Android player sprites to a ""player"" group, and Android enemy sprites to an ""enemy"" group, then make them both use an ""android"" parent group. If you then exclude the ""android"" parent group from the Windows or other platform build, the child groups will be excluded too.","","URL_EN : https://manual.yoyogames.com/index.htm#t=Settings%2FTexture_Groups.htm \n\nURL_JP : https://kuroko137.github.io/gms_manual_jp/index.htm#t=Settings%2FTexture_Groups.htm"
