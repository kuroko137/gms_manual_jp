"Command_Line_Parameters.htm+html.body.p:87-3","When creating games it is important that you play test the executable file to make sure that the final compile is correct and has no unforeseen errors or differences. However creating an executable means that, since you have no access to the debug console nor to the compiler window, it can be difficult to pin down and debug any problems that you may find. However there is a fix for this, and that is to use <strong>command line parameters</strong> to set certain properties when the executable version of the game is run, in turn permitting you to create output log files and test other special situations.","","URL_EN : https://manual.yoyogames.com/index.htm#t=Settings%2FCommand_Line_Parameters.htm \n\nURL_JP : https://kuroko137.github.io/gms_manual_jp/index.htm#t=Settings%2FCommand_Line_Parameters.htm"
