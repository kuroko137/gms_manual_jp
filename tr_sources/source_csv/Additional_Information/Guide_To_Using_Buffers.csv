"Guide_To_Using_Buffers.htm+html.body.div.p:267-5","The asynchronous event will contain a special temporary DS map <span class=""inline"">async_load</span> (it is removed from memory at the end of the event automatically) which contains different information depending on the type of incoming data from the network. In this case, we are assuming that the map has been checked and found to be a buffer data packet sent from a client. We now check the first piece of data that is in the buffer to see what kind of event has been sent - in this case the value ""1"" represents a key event, however when coding these things you should define constants to hold these values to simplify things - and then store the key being pressed and its state (<span class=""inline"">true</span> = pressed, <span class=""inline"">false</span> = released). This information would then be used to update all the clients with the new status of the sending client player.","","URL_EN : https://manual.yoyogames.com/index.htm#t=Additional_Information%2FGuide_To_Using_Buffers.htm \n\nURL_JP : https://kuroko137.github.io/gms_manual_jp/index.htm#t=Additional_Information%2FGuide_To_Using_Buffers.htm"
