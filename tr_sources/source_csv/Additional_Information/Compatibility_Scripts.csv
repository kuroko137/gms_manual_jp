"Compatibility_Scripts.htm+html.body.p:87-3","For those users coming from previous versions of GameMaker, it may be a bit confusing using GameMaker Studio 2 at first since there have been a number of changes made to the way that project assets, editing and coding are handled. These changes mean that the neither the <a class=""tooltip"" title=""TITLE_KEY::IDE"">IDE</a> nor the <a href=""../GameMaker_Language/GameMaker_Language_Index.htm"">GameMaker Language (GML)</a> supports the items listed below. However, that does not mean that you cannot import games made with previous versions into GameMaker Studio 2, as you can. GameMaker Studio 2 will automatically convert all legacy functions into <strong>compatibility scripts</strong>, which are scripts containing functions that convert the legacy methods into the updated methods.","","URL_EN : https://manual.yoyogames.com/index.htm#t=Additional_Information%2FCompatibility_Scripts.htm \n\nURL_JP : https://kuroko137.github.io/gms_manual_jp/index.htm#t=Additional_Information%2FCompatibility_Scripts.htm"

These scripts will contain either the new equivalent <a href=""../GameMaker_Language/GML_Overview/Runtime_Functions.htm"">runtime function</a> or a short <a href=""../GameMaker_Language/GML_Overview/Script_Functions.htm"">script function</a> that performs the same action as the obsolete function.","","URL_EN : https://manual.yoyogames.com/index.htm#t=Additional_Information%2FCompatibility_Scripts.htm \n\nURL_JP : https://kuroko137.github.io/gms_manual_jp/index.htm#t=Additional_Information%2FCompatibility_Scripts.htm"
