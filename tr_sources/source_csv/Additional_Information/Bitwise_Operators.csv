"Bitwise_Operators.htm+html.body.div.p:226-5","Since 16 frames is a power of 2 number, and since 0 is included in the counter, we can reduce the power of 2 number by 1 and use it as a MASK, and using that we can use it to wrap our counter. If the counter moves from 15 to 16, we end up with bit pattern <span class=""inline"">10000</span>, and if we then <span class=""inline"">AND</span> with 15 (bit pattern <span class=""inline"">01111</span>) we end up with 0.
