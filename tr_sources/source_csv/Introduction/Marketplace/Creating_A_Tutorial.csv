"Creating_A_Tutorial.htm+html.body.p:87-3","Creating a tutorial is similar to <a href=""Creating_A_Marketplace_Asset.htm"">creating a regular Marketplace asset package</a>, only now you have to add in specific included files as well as include an initial tutorial page (and an optional video page). The Tutorial workspace will look something like this:<img alt=""{IMG_TXT} Marketplace Tutorial Package"" class=""center"" src=""../../assets/Images/Introduction/Tools_Marketplace_CreateTutorial.png"" style=""width: 100%; max-width: 1169px;"" />As explained above for general Marketplace Assets, you need to select a publisher and then give your tutorial a name and a unique ID (reverse URL format), and then in the ""type"" dropdown select Tutorial. This will then give you additional options to add a base HTML file to start the tutorial from as well as an (optional) video file and URL. The video file should use the template supplied from the Marketplace - as should the rest of the tutorial - which you can get <a href=""https://marketplace{-dot-}yoyogames{-dot-}com/assets/5132/tutorial-templates"">here</a>, and when the user loads the tutorial, the video will be loaded into a separate frame within the IDE. Note that the pages you give for the start page and the video page are relative paths within the Included Files, and you can open an explorer to choose something other than the default ones that GameMaker Studio 2 populates the fields with.","","URL_EN : https://manual.yoyogames.com/index.htm#t=Introduction%2FMarketplace%2FCreating_A_Tutorial.htm \n\nURL_JP : https://kuroko137.github.io/gms_manual_jp/index.htm#t=Introduction%2FMarketplace%2FCreating_A_Tutorial.htm"
"Creating_A_Tutorial.htm+html.body.p:93-3","Actually creating your tutorial will require you to add <a href=""../../Settings/Included_Files.htm"">Included Files</a> into your tutorial project, and these have to be added in a very specific way for the IDE to properly detect which files are to be used for the tutorial.

These folders are imported into the tutorial project and when the user opens the sprite editor and goes to add an image, the default path for the explorer window will be to this location, making it easier for the user to find the necessary assets.","","URL_EN : https://manual.yoyogames.com/index.htm#t=Introduction%2FMarketplace%2FCreating_A_Tutorial.htm \n\nURL_JP : https://kuroko137.github.io/gms_manual_jp/index.htm#t=Introduction%2FMarketplace%2FCreating_A_Tutorial.htm"
