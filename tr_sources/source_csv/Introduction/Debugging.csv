"Debugging.htm+html.body.p:87-3","When programming your game, whether using the GameMaker Language (GML) or Drag and Drop™ (DnD™), it can be very easy to make mistakes - using the wrong variables, passing the wrong arguments, or using the wrong functions are just some of the most common errors we all make - and these mistakes are not always detected by the <a class=""tooltip"" title=""TITLE_KEY::syntax"">syntax</a> checker that is included with the script/action editor. That means that these mistakes will only become apparent when you actually run or compile your game, and even then it can sometimes be difficult to know exactly what is going wrong. It can therefore be of vital importance to know how your game is performing on the chosen device, as well as see what instances are in the room, what global variables have been created and a whole host of other details. Checking these things is called ""<strong>debugging your code</strong>"", and any errors or issues you may find are called ""<strong>bugs</strong>"".","","URL_EN : https://manual.yoyogames.com/index.htm#t=Introduction%2FDebugging.htm \n\nURL_JP : https://kuroko137.github.io/gms_manual_jp/index.htm#t=Introduction%2FDebugging.htm"
"Debugging.htm+html.body.p:91-3","Now, you can check a lot of these things yourself by adding in so-called ""debug code"" to your games to display on the screen the information you require, or you can have it that it shows messages when there is an error, but this is often a lot of work and if you aren't sure where the problem is in the first place then it can be a time consuming case of trial and error to track down your bug. For that, GameMaker Studio 2 has a special test mode called <strong>Debug Mode</strong> which will start the <strong>Debug Module</strong>, and there is also a comprehensive <strong>error reporting system</strong> which displays messages on <a class=""tooltip"" title=""TITLE_KEY::Compiling"">Compiling</a> to help you track down any problems with your game.","","URL_EN : https://manual.yoyogames.com/index.htm#t=Introduction%2FDebugging.htm \n\nURL_JP : https://kuroko137.github.io/gms_manual_jp/index.htm#t=Introduction%2FDebugging.htm"

"Debugging.htm+html.body.div.p:99-5","Most compiler error messages follow the same outline, with a message stating the object that the error has occurred in, then the Event along with the line number, and then finally a short description of the error itself. This type of information being provided by the error reporting is very important as it detects and reports the syntax and language related bugs that are going to cause your finished game to crash, but it won't report more subtle bugs, nor does it give feedback on performance. For those types of things you should use Debug Mode (explained below).","","URL_EN : https://manual.yoyogames.com/index.htm#t=Introduction%2FDebugging.htm \n\nURL_JP : https://kuroko137.github.io/gms_manual_jp/index.htm#t=Introduction%2FDebugging.htm"

"Debugging.htm+html.body.div.p:109-5","If you need to check things more carefully, you can run the game in <strong>Debug Mode</strong> by clicking the debug run button <img alt=""{IMG_TXT} Debug Icon"" class=""icon"" src=""../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_Debug.png"" style=""width: 100%; max-width: 24px;"" />. When you do, the <strong>Debug Module</strong> will open along with your game.

"Debugging.htm+html.body.div.p:114-5","Note that when you use the Debug Module, you can also add <strong>Breakpoints </strong>to your code or DnD™. A breakpoint is a point in the game loop where you want the debug module to pause and let you step through the actual game code a line at a time.
