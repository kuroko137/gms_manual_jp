"File_Watcher.htm+html.body.p:88-3","The <strong>File Watcher</strong> is the name given to the part of the IDE that watches the files related to a project for any changes due to external software (ie: editing an image in an external editor) or due to internal changes like editing a script asset. In general, these settings shouldn't need to be edited, but on some systems - like those that use an SSD as the save drive for the project files - the file watcher may be informing you of changes when you do things like simply saving the project or whenever you edit any project asset, in which case you may need to change these settings.","","URL_EN : https://manual.yoyogames.com/index.htm#t=Setting_Up_And_Version_Information%2FIDE_Preferences%2FGeneral%2FFile_Watcher.htm \n\nURL_JP : https://kuroko137.github.io/gms_manual_jp/index.htm#t=Setting_Up_And_Version_Information%2FIDE_Preferences%2FGeneral%2FFile_Watcher.htm"
