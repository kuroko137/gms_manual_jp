They are ideal for storing small pieces of information, like interface preferences, local high scores, level data etc... and are very easy to use. Ini files don't have to have been created previously to use these actions, and you can read from a non-existent Ini file and you'll simply get a <tt>default</tt> return value (which you specify), however we recommend that you create at least a ""base"" ini file for opening and modifying before using the actions. This base ini file can be created by simply calling the <a a="""" href=""Open_Ini_File.htm"">Open Ini File</a> action followed by the <a href=""Close_Ini_File.htm"">Close Ini File</a>, since closing the file will write it to the disk, or you can include one in the <a href=""../../../Settings/Included_Files.htm"">Included Files</a> of the Asset Browser.
