You supply the unique ID value for the type to set the size of (as returned when you created the type with the action <a href=""Create_Particle_Type.htm"">Create Particle Type</a>) and then give a range of initial starting speeds, then the increase amount and finally the ""wiggle"". The speed a particle is created at is calculated as pixels-per-game-frame, so a minimum setting of 2 and a maximum setting of 5 will emit particles moving at anywhere between 2 and 5 pixels-per-game-frame.","","URL_EN : https://manual.yoyogames.com/index.htm#t=Drag_And_Drop%2FDrag_And_Drop_Reference%2FParticles%2FSet_Particle_Speed.htm \n\nURL_JP : https://kuroko137.github.io/gms_manual_jp/index.htm#t=Drag_And_Drop%2FDrag_And_Drop_Reference%2FParticles%2FSet_Particle_Speed.htm"
"Set_Particle_Speed.htm+html.body.p:90-3","The option to increase a particle speed enables you to input a value which will be added on to the base speed value each game frame of the particle lifetime. So setting this value to, for example, 0.1 will add 0.1 to the speed each game frame. Note that you can use negative values here too to make the particle slow down too, although the speed will never go below 0. Note that the minimum speed <i>decrement</i> that is accepted is -0.01 and the minimum <i>increment</i> is 0.01.","","URL_EN : https://manual.yoyogames.com/index.htm#t=Drag_And_Drop%2FDrag_And_Drop_Reference%2FParticles%2FSet_Particle_Speed.htm \n\nURL_JP : https://kuroko137.github.io/gms_manual_jp/index.htm#t=Drag_And_Drop%2FDrag_And_Drop_Reference%2FParticles%2FSet_Particle_Speed.htm"
