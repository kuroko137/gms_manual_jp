"Save_Game.htm+html.body.p:87-3","This action will do a basic save of the game to a given file. You give a filename (as a string and including the extension) and the action will perform a limited save out of the current game state. It's important to understand that the action is designed to take a ""snapshot"" of the current game state and is for use more as a checkpoint system than a universal save system, since it does <i>not</i> save any of the dynamic resources (like <a href=""../Data_Structures/Data_Structure_Actions.htm"">Data Structures</a> or <a href=""../Particles/Particle_Actions.htm"">Particles</a>). As such the action should be used very carefully so as not to get errors or memory leaks. For a more comprehensive approach to saving your game data, see the <a href=""../Files/File_Actions.htm"">File Actions</a>.","","URL_EN : https://manual.yoyogames.com/index.htm#t=Drag_And_Drop%2FDrag_And_Drop_Reference%2FGame%2FSave_Game.htm \n\nURL_JP : https://kuroko137.github.io/gms_manual_jp/index.htm#t=Drag_And_Drop%2FDrag_And_Drop_Reference%2FGame%2FSave_Game.htm"
