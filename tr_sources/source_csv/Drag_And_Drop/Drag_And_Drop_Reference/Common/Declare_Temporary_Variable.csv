"Declare_Temporary_Variable.htm+html.body.p:87-3","This action is used to declare and give an initial value to a <b>temporary variable </b>(also called a <b>local variable</b>), which is a variable that <i>only exists for the duration of the event or script that it was declared in</i>. Temporary variables are very useful for storing values that are only needed for a single operation and prevent your objects becoming ""cluttered"" with variables that may only be used once. They are also very useful for breaking down complex operations, or for setting values in other instances when you change the action scope. This is because variables declared as temporary are<i>not</i>scoped to any particular instance, but instead scoped to the event or script itself, so if you create a temporary variable and then change the action scope using the <a href=""Apply_To...htm"">Apply To...</a> action, you can still check the temporary variable without issues and without changing its action scope.","","URL_EN : https://manual.yoyogames.com/index.htm#t=Drag_And_Drop%2FDrag_And_Drop_Reference%2FCommon%2FDeclare_Temporary_Variable.htm \n\nURL_JP : https://kuroko137.github.io/gms_manual_jp/index.htm#t=Drag_And_Drop%2FDrag_And_Drop_Reference%2FCommon%2FDeclare_Temporary_Variable.htm"
