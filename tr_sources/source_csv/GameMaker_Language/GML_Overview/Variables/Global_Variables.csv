"Global_Variables.htm+html.body.p:87-3","A basic description of a <strong>global </strong>variable is one that, once declared, it belongs to no instance in particular and yet can be accessed by all. Just like <a href=""Local_Variables.htm"">local variables</a>, global variables must be declared using an identifier, but unlike a local variable, a global variable remains in memory <em>until the end of the game</em>. So, you can create a global variable to keep track of (for example) the number of bullets that the player has and then just update this variable at different points in the game, form any instance or function and at any time. Essentially, a global variable does not belong to any specific instance and can be accessed, changed and used by all instances, and any changes made to the variable are ""global"", in that all instances using the variable will be affected by the change. Let's have a look at an example:","","URL_EN : https://manual.yoyogames.com/index.htm#t=GameMaker_Language%2FGML_Overview%2FVariables%2FGlobal_Variables.htm \n\nURL_JP : https://kuroko137.github.io/gms_manual_jp/index.htm#t=GameMaker_Language%2FGML_Overview%2FVariables%2FGlobal_Variables.htm"

So, we have created a new variable called ""<span class=""inline"">food</span>"" and we have declared it as global.

As with <i>local</i> variables you have to take care not to name your global variables the same as any instance variables as that may cause you problems and make bugs creep into your games due to variable overlap, which can be a difficult issue to debug sometimes. In general you should have a single object that declares all your global variables at the very start of the game (for example, in the <a href=""../../../The_Asset_Editors/Object_Properties/Other_Events.htm"">Room Start Event</a> of the first object instance placed in the first room of the game) or a single <a href=""../Script_Functions.htm"">script function</a> that declares them all together, as this gives you a handy place to go back and reference everything at once should you need to check a variable name or edit a value.","","URL_EN : https://manual.yoyogames.com/index.htm#t=GameMaker_Language%2FGML_Overview%2FVariables%2FGlobal_Variables.htm \n\nURL_JP : https://kuroko137.github.io/gms_manual_jp/index.htm#t=GameMaker_Language%2FGML_Overview%2FVariables%2FGlobal_Variables.htm"
