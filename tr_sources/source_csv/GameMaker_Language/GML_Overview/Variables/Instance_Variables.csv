"Instance_Variables.htm+html.body.p:87-3","An <strong>instance </strong>variable is created within an instance of an object and is considered unique to that instance - ie: many instances of the same object can have the same variable, but each variable can hold a different value as they are <em>unique </em>to each instance. But <i>how</i> is an instance variable created? Well, you create new variables by simply assigning a value to them as shown in this small example (this is called <em>declaring</em> the variable):","","URL_EN : https://manual.yoyogames.com/index.htm#t=GameMaker_Language%2FGML_Overview%2FVariables%2FInstance_Variables.htm \n\nURL_JP : https://kuroko137.github.io/gms_manual_jp/index.htm#t=GameMaker_Language%2FGML_Overview%2FVariables%2FInstance_Variables.htm"

You would have to go through ALL your code and change every -2 to whatever the new value is, which is time consuming and very error prone!

It should also be noted that even if a value is not going to change it is far easier to remember what a variable called ""<span class=""inline"">life</span>"" means rather than just looking at a number.","","URL_EN : https://manual.yoyogames.com/index.htm#t=GameMaker_Language%2FGML_Overview%2FVariables%2FInstance_Variables.htm \n\nURL_JP : https://kuroko137.github.io/gms_manual_jp/index.htm#t=GameMaker_Language%2FGML_Overview%2FVariables%2FInstance_Variables.htm"
