"Structs.htm+html.body.p:180-3","One final thing to mention about structs is that you can change what is output to the console from them for debugging. By default, calling the function <a href=""../GML_Reference/Debugging/show_debug_overlay.htm""><span class=""inline"">show_debug_message()</span></a> on a struct will output the contents of the struct (as shown above). However, it's possible to customise this message by adding a specifically named method to the struct called <span class=""inline"">toString</span>:","","URL_EN : https://manual.yoyogames.com/index.htm#t=GameMaker_Language%2FGML_Overview%2FStructs.htm \n\nURL_JP : https://kuroko137.github.io/gms_manual_jp/index.htm#t=GameMaker_Language%2FGML_Overview%2FStructs.htm"
