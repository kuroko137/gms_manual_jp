"steam_set_stat_avg_rate.htm+html.body.p:117-3","Since the average stat function can be complex to understand, we will illustrate its use with the following example. Consider the case where you'd like to track an average statistic, such as ""Points earned per hour"". One approach would be to have two stats: an <i>integer</i> stat, ""TotalPoints"", and a <i>float</i> stat ""TotalPlayTimeHours"", and then divide the total points by the total time to get the ""Points per Hour"" value.","","URL_EN : https://manual.yoyogames.com/index.htm#t=GameMaker_Language%2FGML_Reference%2FSteam%2FSteam_Achievements%2Fsteam_set_stat_avg_rate.htm \n\nURL_JP : https://kuroko137.github.io/gms_manual_jp/index.htm#t=GameMaker_Language%2FGML_Reference%2FSteam%2FSteam_Achievements%2Fsteam_set_stat_avg_rate.htm"
"steam_set_stat_avg_rate.htm+html.body.p:119-3","However, once the player has accumulated a significant amount of playtime, the calculated average will change extremely slowly, and the more the user plays the game, the less responsive that average will be. If the user has spent 100 hours playing the game, the calculated average will ""lag"" by about 50 hours of that, and if they increase their skill, they will not see the increase in ""Points Per Hour"" that they expect. To get around that we can use a ""sliding window"" to only calculate the ""Points per hour"" for the last 10 hours played.","","URL_EN : https://manual.yoyogames.com/index.htm#t=GameMaker_Language%2FGML_Reference%2FSteam%2FSteam_Achievements%2Fsteam_set_stat_avg_rate.htm \n\nURL_JP : https://kuroko137.github.io/gms_manual_jp/index.htm#t=GameMaker_Language%2FGML_Reference%2FSteam%2FSteam_Achievements%2Fsteam_set_stat_avg_rate.htm"
