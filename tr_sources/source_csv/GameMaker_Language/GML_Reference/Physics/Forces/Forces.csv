"Forces.htm+html.body.p:87-3","In the GameMaker Studio 2 physics world, instances aren't only affected by gravity and collisions, they are also affected by the forces that you choose to apply to them, and knowing the right force to apply is very important when you want to control an instance correctly within the physics simulation. There are two forces which can be used and applied to your fixtures:","","URL_EN : https://manual.yoyogames.com/index.htm#t=GameMaker_Language%2FGML_Reference%2FPhysics%2FForces%2FForces.htm \n\nURL_JP : https://kuroko137.github.io/gms_manual_jp/index.htm#t=GameMaker_Language%2FGML_Reference%2FPhysics%2FForces%2FForces.htm"
