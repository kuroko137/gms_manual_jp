"physics_joint_wheel_create.htm+html.body.p:156-3","A wheel joint simply combines a piston and a revolute joint, like a wheel mounted on the shock absorber of a car. You specify the anchor point for the joint well as the two physics enabled instances to joint, and the first instance will act as the ""body"" for the joint, while the second will be the ""wheel"", and be permitted to move freely around the joint axis. You can also set an axis vector, which is the imaginary line along which the joint will act as a ""spring"" permitting the wheel to bounce up and down along it as it encounters obstacles (much like the piston joint).
