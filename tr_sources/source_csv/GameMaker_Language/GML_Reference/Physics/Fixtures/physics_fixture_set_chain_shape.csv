"physics_fixture_set_chain_shape.htm+html.body.p:87-3","This function defines a ""chain"" fixture shape. A chain fixture is comprised of a number of points, which are then connected together using edge shapes to join them. The function itself takes the index (ID) of the fixture and can tell the fixture to loop or not. Setting this to <tt>true</tt> will connect the last point to the first point with an edge, while setting it to <tt>false</tt> will not. Note that this function on prepares the fixture to accept the points required to make the chain, and these should be added after calling this function using <a href=""physics_fixture_add_point.htm""><tt>physics_fixture_add_point()</tt></a>, much as you would when building a polygon fixture.","","URL_EN : https://manual.yoyogames.com/index.htm#t=GameMaker_Language%2FGML_Reference%2FPhysics%2FFixtures%2Fphysics_fixture_set_chain_shape.htm \n\nURL_JP : https://kuroko137.github.io/gms_manual_jp/index.htm#t=GameMaker_Language%2FGML_Reference%2FPhysics%2FFixtures%2Fphysics_fixture_set_chain_shape.htm"
