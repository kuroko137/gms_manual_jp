"Fixtures.htm+html.body.p:91-3","Before an instance in GameMaker Studio 2 can have physical properties it must have a fixture assigned to it. A fixture binds a shape or form to the instance and this adds material properties such as density, friction, and restitution. Fixtures can be boxes, circles, polygons or any other simple shape you wish as GameMaker Studio 2 provides functions that enable you to define your own shape point by point, and then once you have your shape you can go ahead and define its physical properties too. These properties are what govern the way the instance with the fixture assigned to it will react with other instance in the physics world and are listed below:","","URL_EN : https://manual.yoyogames.com/index.htm#t=GameMaker_Language%2FGML_Reference%2FPhysics%2FFixtures%2FFixtures.htm \n\nURL_JP : https://kuroko137.github.io/gms_manual_jp/index.htm#t=GameMaker_Language%2FGML_Reference%2FPhysics%2FFixtures%2FFixtures.htm"

If you wish your fixture to be <i>static</i> (ie: immovable) then the density should be set to 0, essentially making it infinitely dense. <i>Kinematic</i> objects that move with constant velocity and are not physically affected by collisions are also defined using a density of 0.","","URL_EN : https://manual.yoyogames.com/index.htm#t=GameMaker_Language%2FGML_Reference%2FPhysics%2FFixtures%2FFixtures.htm \n\nURL_JP : https://kuroko137.github.io/gms_manual_jp/index.htm#t=GameMaker_Language%2FGML_Reference%2FPhysics%2FFixtures%2FFixtures.htm"
