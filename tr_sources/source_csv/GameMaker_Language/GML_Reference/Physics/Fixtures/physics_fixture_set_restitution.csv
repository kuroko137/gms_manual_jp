"physics_fixture_set_restitution.htm+html.body.p:156-3","In physics, restitution is defined as ""the return of an object or system to its original state after elastic deformation"", but as the fixtures in the GameMaker Studio 2 are really rigid bodies and cannot be deformed, restitution is really a way of saying how ""bouncy"" the fixture is. This setting will affect how much an object ""bounces"" when it collides with other objects and is co-dependent on other forces that act on the instance like gravity and friction, and is usually a value between 0 and 1 (higher values can be used but may give unpredictable results).
