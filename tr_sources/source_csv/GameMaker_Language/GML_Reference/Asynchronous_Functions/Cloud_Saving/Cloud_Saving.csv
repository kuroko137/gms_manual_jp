"Cloud_Saving.htm+html.body.p:87-3","When making games, it is often necessary to store information about the game state in a file of some type, but storing this information on the device is not always the best option as, if the player deleted the game and then re-installs, this information may be lost. To prevent this you can use various different <b>cloud services</b>, which offer data storage over the internet for retrieval and modification at any time. You should note that this function is limited to <b>one</b> single data ""blob"" per game, so every time you send a new save to the cloud service, whether it is a string or a file, it will overwrite any previously stored data.","","URL_EN : https://manual.yoyogames.com/index.htm#t=GameMaker_Language%2FGML_Reference%2FAsynchronous_Functions%2FCloud_Saving%2FCloud_Saving.htm \n\nURL_JP : https://kuroko137.github.io/gms_manual_jp/index.htm#t=GameMaker_Language%2FGML_Reference%2FAsynchronous_Functions%2FCloud_Saving%2FCloud_Saving.htm"
