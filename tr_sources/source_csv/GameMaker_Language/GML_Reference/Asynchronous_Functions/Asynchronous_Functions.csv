"Asynchronous_Functions.htm+html.body.p:87-3","In the context of GameMaker Studio 2, an asynchronous function is one that sends out to a web server, or asks for user input, or even streams data, while letting GameMaker Studio 2 continue to run without blocking the game being run. When the information <a class=""tooltip"" title=""TITLE_KEY::callback"">callback</a> is received a special <b>Async Event</b> is fired which, in turn, allows any instance with an Async Event assigned to it to execute further functions (although this does not have to be the case). So, basically, it's a way to communicate with some external resource (server, user or device) without the game or project stopping while waiting for a reply.","","URL_EN : https://manual.yoyogames.com/index.htm#t=GameMaker_Language%2FGML_Reference%2FAsynchronous_Functions%2FAsynchronous_Functions.htm \n\nURL_JP : https://kuroko137.github.io/gms_manual_jp/index.htm#t=GameMaker_Language%2FGML_Reference%2FAsynchronous_Functions%2FAsynchronous_Functions.htm"
