"buffer_tell.htm+html.body.p:87-3","When you read or write data to a buffer using the <a href=""buffer_read.htm""><tt>buffer_read()</tt></a> or <a href=""buffer_write.htm""><tt>buffer_write()</tt></a> the current ""seek"" position is advanced by the bytes written or read, and with this function you can get the current ""seek"" position for use in other buffer functions. For example, if your buffer alignment is set to 4 bytes and you write a single piece of data which is 1 byte in size then do a <tt>buffer_tell()</tt>, you'll get an return value of 1. However, if you write another piece of data, also 1 byte in size, then do a <tt>buffer_tell()</tt>, you'll get a return value of 5 as the alignment has ""padded"" the data to that position.","","URL_EN : https://manual.yoyogames.com/index.htm#t=GameMaker_Language%2FGML_Reference%2FBuffers%2Fbuffer_tell.htm \n\nURL_JP : https://kuroko137.github.io/gms_manual_jp/index.htm#t=GameMaker_Language%2FGML_Reference%2FBuffers%2Fbuffer_tell.htm"
