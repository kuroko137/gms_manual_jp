"object_set_persistent.htm+html.body.p:87-3","With this function you can set the persistence of a specific object. A persistent object is ""carried over"" from room to room and maintains its properties at all times (for more information on persistence see the section on the <a href=""../../../../The_Asset_Editors/Objects.htm"">Object Editor</a>). Setting the persistence of the object means that all instances of this object that are created <i>after the persistence has been changed</i> will be created persistent, while instances that are already in the room may not be affected.","","URL_EN : https://manual.yoyogames.com/index.htm#t=GameMaker_Language%2FGML_Reference%2FAsset_Management%2FObjects%2Fobject_set_persistent.htm \n\nURL_JP : https://kuroko137.github.io/gms_manual_jp/index.htm#t=GameMaker_Language%2FGML_Reference%2FAsset_Management%2FObjects%2Fobject_set_persistent.htm"
"object_set_persistent.htm+html.body.p:89-3","When you create an instance with persistence enabled in a room, it will be assigned a layer or a depth (depending on which function you used to create the instance of the object). When the room is changed, and if the following room does <i>not</i> have a layer with the same name or depth as the one assigned, then a new layer will be created for the instance that is persisting across the rooms. If you gave a named layer when the instance was created, then the new layer will also be named the same as original layer, while if you assigned a depth to the instance then the new layer will be named ""<tt>_layer_XXX</tt>"", where ""XXX"" is a hex value used to give the layer a unique name. These layers will be removed from the room on Room End. Another thing to note about layers and persistent instances is that if you have assigned the instance a named layer on creation, and there is another layer in the following rooms with the same name, then the persisted instance will be assigned to the layer with the same name <i>regardless of the depth of the layer</i>. Finally, if a persisted instance moves to a room with a layer at the same depth as the instance was created on, it will <i>not</i> be assigned to this layer, but instead a new layer will be created at the same depth (following the naming convention explained previously).","","URL_EN : https://manual.yoyogames.com/index.htm#t=GameMaker_Language%2FGML_Reference%2FAsset_Management%2FObjects%2Fobject_set_persistent.htm \n\nURL_JP : https://kuroko137.github.io/gms_manual_jp/index.htm#t=GameMaker_Language%2FGML_Reference%2FAsset_Management%2FObjects%2Fobject_set_persistent.htm"
