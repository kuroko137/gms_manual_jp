There are many options here which allow complete simulation of all possible events, but note that this literally just performs all the code in the event and the game will not modify anything to make it trigger itself manually, for example if you choose to perform a keyboard press event, the event will be triggered but the relevant key will not be recognised as having been pressed. Or if you perform an alarm event, the alarm counter will not be set to -1 but rather continue to count down.
