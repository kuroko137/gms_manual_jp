"Attachments.htm+html.body.p:87-3","Skeleton animation sprites can have ""slots"" where you can place ""attachments"". An attachment is simply an image that can used as a prop by the sprite, and is placed in a slot so that it will move along with the animation of the part where the slot is positioned. If you imagine the sprite of a warrior with an attachment slot on his hand - you can then place different weapon sprites on this slot and make the warrior look like he's using a sword or a pike or a shield or whatever.","","URL_EN : https://manual.yoyogames.com/index.htm#t=GameMaker_Language%2FGML_Reference%2FAsset_Management%2FSprites%2FSkeletal_Animation%2FAttachments%2FAttachments.htm \n\nURL_JP : https://kuroko137.github.io/gms_manual_jp/index.htm#t=GameMaker_Language%2FGML_Reference%2FAsset_Management%2FSprites%2FSkeletal_Animation%2FAttachments%2FAttachments.htm"
