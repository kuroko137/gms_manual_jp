"path_delete_point.htm+html.body.p:87-3","With this function you can remove a point from the specified path. Path points are numbered from 0 so the first point is always the 0th point and the last path point will be <a href=""../path_get_number.htm""><tt>path_get_number()</tt></a> - 1. If you call this function on a path asset, <strong>then the removal of the point will be permanent</strong> and all instances assigned the path in the future will be missing the point that was removed. If this is not what you require, then you should use a function like <span class=""inline""><a href=""path_duplicate.htm"">path_duplicate()</a></span> to create a copy of the path first, then call this function on the duplicated asset (don't forget to call <span class=""inline""><a href=""path_delete.htm"">path_delete()</a></span> on the asset when it is no longer required).","","URL_EN : https://manual.yoyogames.com/index.htm#t=GameMaker_Language%2FGML_Reference%2FAsset_Management%2FPaths%2FPath_Manipulation%2Fpath_delete_point.htm \n\nURL_JP : https://kuroko137.github.io/gms_manual_jp/index.htm#t=GameMaker_Language%2FGML_Reference%2FAsset_Management%2FPaths%2FPath_Manipulation%2Fpath_delete_point.htm"
