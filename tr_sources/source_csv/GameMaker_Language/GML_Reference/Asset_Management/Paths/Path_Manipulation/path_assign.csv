"path_assign.htm+html.body.p:87-3","With this function you can copy the path data from one path to another. The path being copied <i>to</i> will be cleared first (should it have any path points) and be <strong>completely overwritten</strong> by the path being copied from. Neither path is deleted in the process and the result is two paths, with two different indexes, but the exact same form and points. In general you would want to use this function on a path created using <span class=""inline""><a href=""path_add.htm"">path_add()</a></span>, since if you use it on a path asset, <strong>it will permanently affect the path for all instances in the game</strong> from the moment the function is used until the end of the game.","","URL_EN : https://manual.yoyogames.com/index.htm#t=GameMaker_Language%2FGML_Reference%2FAsset_Management%2FPaths%2FPath_Manipulation%2Fpath_assign.htm \n\nURL_JP : https://kuroko137.github.io/gms_manual_jp/index.htm#t=GameMaker_Language%2FGML_Reference%2FAsset_Management%2FPaths%2FPath_Manipulation%2Fpath_assign.htm"
