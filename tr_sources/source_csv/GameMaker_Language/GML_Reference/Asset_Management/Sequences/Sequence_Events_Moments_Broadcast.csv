"Sequence_Events_Moments_Broadcast.htm+html.body.p:158-3","To create a broadcast message on a sequence using GML, you need to add them to a frame in the <tt>messageEventKeyframes</tt> property of the sequence struct. This is essentially a ""special"" track that is only used for this purpose and so can only take keyframe data that is associated with the broadcast messages that you want the sequence to have. This track is created in much the same way as you would create any other track, by creating keyframe structs and filling them with keyframe data, where channel 0 is the only channel that you can use and the track type is <tt>seqtracktype_message</tt>.
