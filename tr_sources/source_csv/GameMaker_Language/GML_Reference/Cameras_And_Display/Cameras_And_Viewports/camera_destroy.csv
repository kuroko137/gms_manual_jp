You should <i>never</i> destroy a camera that is currently assigned to a visible view, unless you are assigning a new camera to that view in the same step, and you should <i>always</i> destroy any cameras that you have created through code when no longer required by your game to prevent memory leaks, and you can also destroy the default cameras if you have any assigned in the Room Editor, but you should assign a new camera to the view port (or disable it) otherwise you will get odd results.","","URL_EN : https://manual.yoyogames.com/index.htm#t=GameMaker_Language%2FGML_Reference%2FCameras_And_Display%2FCameras_And_Viewports%2Fcamera_destroy.htm \n\nURL_JP : https://kuroko137.github.io/gms_manual_jp/index.htm#t=GameMaker_Language%2FGML_Reference%2FCameras_And_Display%2FCameras_And_Viewports%2Fcamera_destroy.htm"
