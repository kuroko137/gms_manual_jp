"view_xport.htm+html.body.p:87-3","With this built in array you can get or set the x position of the given view port. The view port is the area on the screen where the view is drawn, and you can have up to 8 active at any one time (the array is values from 0 to 7 inclusive to give 8 ports). Now, the default for GameMaker Studio 2 is that the game window (or background canvas) is the same size as the room, however when you activate view ports and cameras, this behaviour changes and the <i>total size of the bounding box for all view ports</i> is used. So, if you have two different view ports at two different positions, the total area that they cover defines the size of the game window.
