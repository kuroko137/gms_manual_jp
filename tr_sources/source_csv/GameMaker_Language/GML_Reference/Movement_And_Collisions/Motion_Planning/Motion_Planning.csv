"Motion_Planning.htm+html.body.p:87-3","In many games you want opponents, NPC's, enemies etc... to interact with the player and show certain intelligence when moving around ie: you want them to avoid obstacles, plan routes and generally not bump into everything in their path! To aid in this GameMaker Studio 2 has a series of functions that deal with motion planning. Note that while these are designed for things like game enemies, they can be used for all sorts of things like creating a smooth way to introduce text, or to create transitions etc... However, whatever you choose to use from the list below in your game, it should be noted that in many situations a single function set will not give you a perfect solution and that you will have to ""mix and match"" the functions, using one or the other depending on the situation within your game.","","URL_EN : https://manual.yoyogames.com/index.htm#t=GameMaker_Language%2FGML_Reference%2FMovement_And_Collisions%2FMotion_Planning%2FMotion_Planning.htm \n\nURL_JP : https://kuroko137.github.io/gms_manual_jp/index.htm#t=GameMaker_Language%2FGML_Reference%2FMovement_And_Collisions%2FMotion_Planning%2FMotion_Planning.htm"
