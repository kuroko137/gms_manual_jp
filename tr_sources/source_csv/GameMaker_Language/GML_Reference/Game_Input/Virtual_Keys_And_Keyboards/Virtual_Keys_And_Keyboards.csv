This is done by assigning a ""virtual Key"" to an internally mapped standard keyboard key and then using the keyboard events that they generate to control your application. It is worth noting that these ""virtual keys"" are mapped to the <i>screen</i> position rather than room position and so the x/y values are absolute, based on the display size. This means that you don't need to worry about the use of views or the relative room coordinates, and can simply define the keys in the Create Event of an object (you only need to define a virtual key once per-room), then draw your key sprites in the <a href=""../../../../The_Asset_Editors/Object_Properties/Draw_Events.htm"">Draw GUI Event</a>, sizing the GUI layer to be the same as the screen.","","URL_EN : https://manual.yoyogames.com/index.htm#t=GameMaker_Language%2FGML_Reference%2FGame_Input%2FVirtual_Keys_And_Keyboards%2FVirtual_Keys_And_Keyboards.htm \n\nURL_JP : https://kuroko137.github.io/gms_manual_jp/index.htm#t=GameMaker_Language%2FGML_Reference%2FGame_Input%2FVirtual_Keys_And_Keyboards%2FVirtual_Keys_And_Keyboards.htm"
