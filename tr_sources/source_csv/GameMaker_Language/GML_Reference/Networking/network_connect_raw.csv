"network_connect_raw.htm+html.body.p:87-3","With this function you can send a request to connect to a server. The function takes the <i>socket id</i> to connect through (see <a href=""network_create_socket.htm""><tt>network_create_socket()</tt></a>) and requires you to give the IP address to connect to (a string) as well as the port to connect through, and if the connection fails a value of less than 0 will be returned. The difference between this function and <a href=""network_connect.htm""><tt>network_connect()</tt></a> is that this function can connect to any server and does nothing to the raw data, meaning that you have to implement the protocols yourself at the server end. Note that by default the function is synchronous, meaning that your game may appear to ""hang"" as the connection is made. You can set a timeout value for connection, or alternatively make the creation asynchronous, using the function <a href=""network_set_config.htm""><tt>network_set_config()</tt></a>, or alternatively use the function <a href=""network_connect_raw_async.htm""><span class=""inline"">network_connect_async_raw()</span></a> instead.","","URL_EN : https://manual.yoyogames.com/index.htm#t=GameMaker_Language%2FGML_Reference%2FNetworking%2Fnetwork_connect_raw.htm \n\nURL_JP : https://kuroko137.github.io/gms_manual_jp/index.htm#t=GameMaker_Language%2FGML_Reference%2FNetworking%2Fnetwork_connect_raw.htm"
