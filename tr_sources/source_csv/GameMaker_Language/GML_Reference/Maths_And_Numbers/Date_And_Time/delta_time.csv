"delta_time.htm+html.body.p:91-3","The purpose of delta timing is to eliminate the effects of the lag or slowness of computers that try to handle complex graphics or a lot of code. It is a value that can be added on to the speed of objects so that they will eventually move at the same speed, regardless of lag. This is achieved in GameMaker Studio 2 by using the <b>read only</b> variable <tt>delta_time</tt> every step as it measures the time that has passed between one step and the next in microseconds (1microsecond is 1,000,000th of a second). Therefore the variable <tt>delta_time</tt> can be used to calculate how much faster (for example) a game character has to move to make up for a lag spike in the game.","","URL_EN : https://manual.yoyogames.com/index.htm#t=GameMaker_Language%2FGML_Reference%2FMaths_And_Numbers%2FDate_And_Time%2Fdelta_time.htm \n\nURL_JP : https://kuroko137.github.io/gms_manual_jp/index.htm#t=GameMaker_Language%2FGML_Reference%2FMaths_And_Numbers%2FDate_And_Time%2Fdelta_time.htm"
