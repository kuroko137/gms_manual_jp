"sqrt.htm+html.body.p:90-3","If you multiply a number with itself, you get the square of that number, but sometimes you want to do the reverse and get the square root of a number. So to find what number has been multiplied with itself to get any given <i>positive</i> value we use this function. For example: <tt>sqrt(9)</tt> will return 3 since 3*3=9.","","URL_EN : https://manual.yoyogames.com/index.htm#t=GameMaker_Language%2FGML_Reference%2FMaths_And_Numbers%2FNumber_Functions%2Fsqrt.htm \n\nURL_JP : https://kuroko137.github.io/gms_manual_jp/index.htm#t=GameMaker_Language%2FGML_Reference%2FMaths_And_Numbers%2FNumber_Functions%2Fsqrt.htm"
