"log10.htm+html.body.p:91-3","This function is similar to the <a href=""log2.htm""><tt>log2(n)</tt></a> function, only that <tt>log10(n)</tt> gets the number of 10's that we need to multiply together to get n. So <tt>log10(100)</tt> returns 2, as multiplying 10 by itself gives 100, <tt>log10(1000)</tt> returns 3 as 10x10x10=1000 etc... The number does <i>not</i> have to be divisible by ten, however, but this will still return an appropriate value, for example if we have <tt>log10(101)</tt> we get 2.00432137... which is how many times you could divide 101 by 10.","","URL_EN : https://manual.yoyogames.com/index.htm#t=GameMaker_Language%2FGML_Reference%2FMaths_And_Numbers%2FNumber_Functions%2Flog10.htm \n\nURL_JP : https://kuroko137.github.io/gms_manual_jp/index.htm#t=GameMaker_Language%2FGML_Reference%2FMaths_And_Numbers%2FNumber_Functions%2Flog10.htm"
