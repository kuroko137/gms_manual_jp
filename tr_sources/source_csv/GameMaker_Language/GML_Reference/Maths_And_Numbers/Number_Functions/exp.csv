"exp.htm+html.body.p:91-3","This is the function power(e,n), where e is approximately 2.718281828 (also known as <i>Euler's Number</i>), and n is the number of times it should be multiplied by itself. This basically says ""how much growth do I get after n units of time (and 100% continuous growth)?"". So <tt>exp(3)</tt> would return 20.08, which means that after 3 time units we have 20.08 times the amount we started with.","","URL_EN : https://manual.yoyogames.com/index.htm#t=GameMaker_Language%2FGML_Reference%2FMaths_And_Numbers%2FNumber_Functions%2Fexp.htm \n\nURL_JP : https://kuroko137.github.io/gms_manual_jp/index.htm#t=GameMaker_Language%2FGML_Reference%2FMaths_And_Numbers%2FNumber_Functions%2Fexp.htm"
