"choose.htm+html.body.p:91-3","Sometimes you want to specify something other than numbers for a random selection, or the numbers you want are not in any real order or within any set range. In these cases you would use <tt>choose()</tt> to generate a random result. For example, say you want to create an object with a random sprite at the start, then you could use this function to set the sprite index to one of a set of given sprites. Note that you can have as many as you require (note that more arguments will mean that the function will be slower to parse).","","URL_EN : https://manual.yoyogames.com/index.htm#t=GameMaker_Language%2FGML_Reference%2FMaths_And_Numbers%2FNumber_Functions%2Fchoose.htm \n\nURL_JP : https://kuroko137.github.io/gms_manual_jp/index.htm#t=GameMaker_Language%2FGML_Reference%2FMaths_And_Numbers%2FNumber_Functions%2Fchoose.htm"
