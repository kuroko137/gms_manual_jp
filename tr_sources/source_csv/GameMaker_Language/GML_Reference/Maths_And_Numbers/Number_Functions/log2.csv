"log2.htm+html.body.p:91-3","This function basically asks ""how many 2's do you need to multiply to get n?"". A common example of use in programming would be to calculate the number of bits that are needed to represent a number. To do this we calculate the <tt>log2(x)</tt> of the number, round it down and add 1 - for example <tt>log2(100)</tt> returns 6.643856, which rounded down is 6, to which we add one and it gives us 7. So we need 7 bits to represent 100. It can also be used for describing exponential growth or decay, and is often called a <i>binary logarithm</i>.","","URL_EN : https://manual.yoyogames.com/index.htm#t=GameMaker_Language%2FGML_Reference%2FMaths_And_Numbers%2FNumber_Functions%2Flog2.htm \n\nURL_JP : https://kuroko137.github.io/gms_manual_jp/index.htm#t=GameMaker_Language%2FGML_Reference%2FMaths_And_Numbers%2FNumber_Functions%2Flog2.htm"
