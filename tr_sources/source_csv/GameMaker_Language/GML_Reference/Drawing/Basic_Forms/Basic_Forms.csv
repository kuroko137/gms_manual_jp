"Basic_Forms.htm+html.body.p:87-3","GameMaker Studio 2 has a whole collection of functions available for drawing different forms and shapes. These functions should only ever be used in the draw event of an instance (you <i>can</i> use them elsewhere but you won't see anything!) and create purely graphic effects, which means that they do not generate collision events as those can only be done through the sprite or collision mask that has been assigned to an instance. All these functions are affected by the current draw colour, alpha and blend mode (see the section on <a href=""../Colour_And_Alpha/Colour_And_Alpha.htm"">Colour</a>).","","URL_EN : https://manual.yoyogames.com/index.htm#t=GameMaker_Language%2FGML_Reference%2FDrawing%2FBasic_Forms%2FBasic_Forms.htm \n\nURL_JP : https://kuroko137.github.io/gms_manual_jp/index.htm#t=GameMaker_Language%2FGML_Reference%2FDrawing%2FBasic_Forms%2FBasic_Forms.htm"
