"draw_roundrect_colour_ext.htm+html.body.p:87-3","With this function you can draw either an outline of a rounded rectangle or a filled rounded rectangle where the (x1,y1) position is the top left corner and the (x2,y2) position is the bottom right corner. If the rectangle is filled, then the colour arguments will be used to generate a colour gradient from the centre to the edges, where colour 1 is the centre colour and colour 2 the edge colour. You must also supply radius values for the x and y axis (in pixels) and the corners will be rounded by these amounts. You can define how precise the drawing of the corners is with the function <a href=""draw_set_circle_precision.htm""><tt>draw_set_circle_precision()</tt></a>. Please note that the rectangle being drawn may need different values (+/-1 on the x, y, or width or height) to be drawn with the desired dimensions due to differences across the various supported platforms.","","URL_EN : https://manual.yoyogames.com/index.htm#t=GameMaker_Language%2FGML_Reference%2FDrawing%2FBasic_Forms%2Fdraw_roundrect_colour_ext.htm \n\nURL_JP : https://kuroko137.github.io/gms_manual_jp/index.htm#t=GameMaker_Language%2FGML_Reference%2FDrawing%2FBasic_Forms%2Fdraw_roundrect_colour_ext.htm"

If you need to draw shapes in this way then the shader should be customised with this in mind.","","URL_EN : https://manual.yoyogames.com/index.htm#t=GameMaker_Language%2FGML_Reference%2FDrawing%2FBasic_Forms%2Fdraw_roundrect_colour_ext.htm \n\nURL_JP : https://kuroko137.github.io/gms_manual_jp/index.htm#t=GameMaker_Language%2FGML_Reference%2FDrawing%2FBasic_Forms%2Fdraw_roundrect_colour_ext.htm"
