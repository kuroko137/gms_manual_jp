The particles that you define using these functions can be used in any system that you create and the normal procedure would be to define all your particles once at the start of a game and store their index values in global variables. These global variables can then be used to burst, emit or create particles at any time throughout the game. You can also create, use and then destroy particles as needed if memory is an issue or if you wish many different types but only at specific points in your game.
