Please note that if you do not call <a href=""surface_reset_target.htm""><tt>surface_reset_target()</tt></a> after you have finished, nothing will be drawn on the screen as all further drawing (even in other instances) will be done on the surface. You should also realise that nothing will be seen if the surface itself is not drawn on the screen in the draw event of an instance.
