"Surfaces.htm+html.body.p:87-3","In the normal draw events, GameMaker Studio 2 doesn't actually draw directly to the screen, but rather draws to a <b>surface</b> called the <i>application surface</i>. This surface is basically a blank ""canvas"" that can then later be manipulated before being drawn to the screen when needed, and in most cases GameMaker Studio 2 handles this for you (although you can also manipulate it yourself in code for shaders, scaling and many other things - further details are given below).","","URL_EN : https://manual.yoyogames.com/index.htm#t=GameMaker_Language%2FGML_Reference%2FDrawing%2FSurfaces%2FSurfaces.htm \n\nURL_JP : https://kuroko137.github.io/gms_manual_jp/index.htm#t=GameMaker_Language%2FGML_Reference%2FDrawing%2FSurfaces%2FSurfaces.htm"
"Surfaces.htm+html.body.p:89-3","However, apart from this application surface, you can also create your own surfaces and use them to create stunning or subtle special effects in your game. For example, you can use surfaces to ""catch"" instances, which can then be destroyed, and in this way you can create a decal effect where the sprite for the instance is displayed on the surface as if it still existed, permitting graphical effects like debris, blood, etc... without any real processing overhead. Another thing you can do with surfaces is use them as textures to be manipulated, or to create sprites ""on the fly"", or to create complex overlays. in fact, the uses for surfaces are endless!","","URL_EN : https://manual.yoyogames.com/index.htm#t=GameMaker_Language%2FGML_Reference%2FDrawing%2FSurfaces%2FSurfaces.htm \n\nURL_JP : https://kuroko137.github.io/gms_manual_jp/index.htm#t=GameMaker_Language%2FGML_Reference%2FDrawing%2FSurfaces%2FSurfaces.htm"
"Surfaces.htm+html.body.p:92-3","Normal surfaces are quite easy to use, but there are a few basic rules to be followed when you use them:","","URL_EN : https://manual.yoyogames.com/index.htm#t=GameMaker_Language%2FGML_Reference%2FDrawing%2FSurfaces%2FSurfaces.htm \n\nURL_JP : https://kuroko137.github.io/gms_manual_jp/index.htm#t=GameMaker_Language%2FGML_Reference%2FDrawing%2FSurfaces%2FSurfaces.htm"
"Surfaces.htm+html.body.ul.li:94-5","First, you should realise that surfaces (<i>except</i> the application surface) are ""volatile"". This means that if the device or window loses focus or is minimised (good examples are when you ALT +Tab to different window and back again on Windows, or on an Android device when the app loses focus due to a call) then the surface <strong>may be destroyed</strong>. This is because it is stored <em>only</em> in the texture memory (<a class=""tooltip"" title=""TITLE_KEY::VRAM"">VRAM</a>) and may be overwritten when the target platform needs that memory for something else which means that you should <i><b>always</b></i> have some type of fail-safe code in place, usually with the <a href=""surface_exists.htm""><tt>surface_exists()</tt></a> function.","","URL_EN : https://manual.yoyogames.com/index.htm#t=GameMaker_Language%2FGML_Reference%2FDrawing%2FSurfaces%2FSurfaces.htm \n\nURL_JP : https://kuroko137.github.io/gms_manual_jp/index.htm#t=GameMaker_Language%2FGML_Reference%2FDrawing%2FSurfaces%2FSurfaces.htm"
"Surfaces.htm+html.body.p:98-3","<strong>NOTE</strong>: This doesn't appear to happen with sprites or other visual assets (but actually does!) as they are also stored in regular memory (RAM) and when they are removed from texture memory (VRAM) they immediately get restored from regular memory when the game regains focus.","","URL_EN : https://manual.yoyogames.com/index.htm#t=GameMaker_Language%2FGML_Reference%2FDrawing%2FSurfaces%2FSurfaces.htm \n\nURL_JP : https://kuroko137.github.io/gms_manual_jp/index.htm#t=GameMaker_Language%2FGML_Reference%2FDrawing%2FSurfaces%2FSurfaces.htm"
"Surfaces.htm+html.body.ul.li:101-5","Second, you should note that surfaces can require large quantities of VRAM to be used, and so you should attempt to keep them as small as possible. Normally you would try and keep them no larger than the size of the view or display window.","","URL_EN : https://manual.yoyogames.com/index.htm#t=GameMaker_Language%2FGML_Reference%2FDrawing%2FSurfaces%2FSurfaces.htm \n\nURL_JP : https://kuroko137.github.io/gms_manual_jp/index.htm#t=GameMaker_Language%2FGML_Reference%2FDrawing%2FSurfaces%2FSurfaces.htm"
"Surfaces.htm+html.body.ul.li:102-5","Third, you should <b>only create surfaces in the draw event</b>. If you create a surface in the Create Event of an instance, you could potentially get the <i>same</i> index as the <tt>application_surface</tt>. This can then cause lots of problems and confusion as you think you are using your own surface, but you are actually using the current render target. You should also always try to limit <i>drawing</i> to a surface in the draw event too, since due to the optimised way in which GameMaker Studio 2 draws to the screen, it is recommended that you keep all draw functions <i>within the draw event</i> - this includes clearing a surface when it is first created, etc... Drawing to a surface outside of the draw event is possible and may even be necessary for some effects, but it's not how it <em>should</em> be done.","","URL_EN : https://manual.yoyogames.com/index.htm#t=GameMaker_Language%2FGML_Reference%2FDrawing%2FSurfaces%2FSurfaces.htm \n\nURL_JP : https://kuroko137.github.io/gms_manual_jp/index.htm#t=GameMaker_Language%2FGML_Reference%2FDrawing%2FSurfaces%2FSurfaces.htm"
"Surfaces.htm+html.body.ul.li:106-5","Fourth, when drawing to a surface manually, the surface is <i>always</i> at the position of (0,0). This means that you may need to convert <em>absolute</em> coordinates into <em>relative</em> coordinates for the surface. For example, if you have a camera-sized surface and wish to draw something that is currently visible in the camera to that surface, you should subtract the camera view x and y coordinates from the actual x and y coordinates to get a relative position to the surface (0,0) position. So, the code would look something like this:","","URL_EN : https://manual.yoyogames.com/index.htm#t=GameMaker_Language%2FGML_Reference%2FDrawing%2FSurfaces%2FSurfaces.htm \n\nURL_JP : https://kuroko137.github.io/gms_manual_jp/index.htm#t=GameMaker_Language%2FGML_Reference%2FDrawing%2FSurfaces%2FSurfaces.htm"

"Surfaces.htm+html.body.ul.li:120-5","Finally, it is worth noting that drawing to a surface will take into consideration the coloour <em>and</em> the alpha component of each pixel, both from the surface itself and also from what is being drawn to it. This may lead to some rather unintuitive results (for example, drawing a sprite with 0.5 alpha to a surface with 0 alpha will give a final alpha of 0.25).
