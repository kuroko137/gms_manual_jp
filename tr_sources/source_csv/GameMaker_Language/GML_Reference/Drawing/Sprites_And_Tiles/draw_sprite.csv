"draw_sprite.htm+html.body.p:87-3","This function draws the given sprite and sub-image at a position within the game room. For the sprite you can use the instance variable <a href=""../../Asset_Management/Sprites/Sprite_Instance_Variables/sprite_index.htm""><tt>sprite_index</tt></a> to get the current sprite that is assigned to the instance running the code, or you can use any other sprite asset. The same goes for the sub-image, as this can also be set to the instance variable <a href=""../../Asset_Management/Sprites/Sprite_Instance_Variables/image_index.htm""><tt>image_index</tt></a> which will set the sub-image to that selected for the current instance sprite (note, that you can draw a different sprite and still use the sub-image value for the current instance), or you can use any other value for this to draw a specific sub-image of the chosen sprite. If the value is larger than the number of sub-images, then GameMaker Studio 2 will automatically loop the number to select the corresponding image (for example, if the sprite being drawn has 5 sub-images numbered 0 to 4 and we set the index value to 7, then the function will draw sub-image 3, numbered 0). Finally, the x and y position is the position within the room that the sprite will be drawn, and it is centered on the sprite <a href=""../../Asset_Management/Sprites/Sprite_Instance_Variables/sprite_xoffset.htm"">x offset</a> and <a href=""../../Asset_Management/Sprites/Sprite_Instance_Variables/sprite_yoffset.htm"">y offset</a>.","","URL_EN : https://manual.yoyogames.com/index.htm#t=GameMaker_Language%2FGML_Reference%2FDrawing%2FSprites_And_Tiles%2Fdraw_sprite.htm \n\nURL_JP : https://kuroko137.github.io/gms_manual_jp/index.htm#t=GameMaker_Language%2FGML_Reference%2FDrawing%2FSprites_And_Tiles%2Fdraw_sprite.htm"
