Uncompressed sounds are those that have been saved as <span class=""inline"">WAV</span> format files, while compressed sounds can be either <span class=""inline"">MP3</span> or <span class=""inline"">OGG</span> format. In general you'll want small sound effects to be <span class=""inline"">WAV</span> - like shooting sounds, or button sounds, etc... - and larger effects or music to be <span class=""inline"">MP3</span> or <span class=""inline"">OGG</span>. As with the other different resources, it is recommended that you name your sounds using an appropriate prefix like "" <span class=""inline"">snd_</span>"" so you can easily identify it later.","","URL_EN : https://manual.yoyogames.com/index.htm#t=Quick_Start_Guide%2FCreating_Sound_Effects.htm \n\nURL_JP : https://kuroko137.github.io/gms_manual_jp/index.htm#t=Quick_Start_Guide%2FCreating_Sound_Effects.htm"
"Creating_Sound_Effects.htm+html.body.p:94-3","<strong>NOTE</strong>: An uncompressed sound simply means that it has not had any type of compression <strong> <a class=""tooltip"" title=""TITLE_KEY::algorithm"">algorithm</a></strong> applied to it. Applying <a class=""tooltip"" title=""TITLE_KEY::compression"">compression</a> to a sound means that it will require less storage space, but will also mean that it needs to be decompressed before playing, and since small sound effects are generally used a lot and very quickly - and don't take up much storage space - you don't want the extra CPU cost of decompressing it when it's being played. However, since things like music files can generally be very large files, you do want them to be compressed, as they will take up less storage space that way, and the extra CPU cost of decompressing is negligible, since they are only generally being played one at a time.","","URL_EN : https://manual.yoyogames.com/index.htm#t=Quick_Start_Guide%2FCreating_Sound_Effects.htm \n\nURL_JP : https://kuroko137.github.io/gms_manual_jp/index.htm#t=Quick_Start_Guide%2FCreating_Sound_Effects.htm"
