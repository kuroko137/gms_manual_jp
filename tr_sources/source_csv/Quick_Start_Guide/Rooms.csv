Depth ordering is from highest to lowest, so that the lower the depth the nearer the ""camera"" and the higher the depth the further away. For example, a layer with a depth of -300 will render over a layer with a depth of -100, and a layer with a depth of 1000 will render under everything with a depth less than this.
