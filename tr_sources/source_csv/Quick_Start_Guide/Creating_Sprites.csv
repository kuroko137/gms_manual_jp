"Creating_Sprites.htm+html.body.p:88-3","Now that you <a href=""What_Is_Programming_.htm"">know what a program is</a>, it's time to look at some of the different <strong>assets </strong>that can be used in GameMaker Studio 2 to make your game. To start with, we'll look at <strong>sprites</strong>, which are generally one of the first things you'll need when making any project. As explained in the section on <a href=""../Introduction/The_Asset_Browser.htm"">The Asset Browser</a>, a sprite is an image that can be animated (although it doesn't have to be) and then drawn to the screen. In general a sprite will be associated with an object, but you can draw sprites on their own, either from code or in the room editor <strong>Asset Layer</strong> (we'll talk about this in more detail later, in the section on <a href=""Rooms.htm"">rooms</a>). You can also create a sprite to be used as a <a class=""tooltip"" title=""TITLE_KEY::tile_sets"">tile sets</a>, but we'll explore that option in a later section too.","","URL_EN : https://manual.yoyogames.com/index.htm#t=Quick_Start_Guide%2FCreating_Sprites.htm \n\nURL_JP : https://kuroko137.github.io/gms_manual_jp/index.htm#t=Quick_Start_Guide%2FCreating_Sprites.htm"
"Creating_Sprites.htm+html.body.p:92-3","When you create a new project from the <a href=""../Introduction/The_Start_Page.htm"">Start Page</a>, the asset browser will only contain empty folders for the resources you may need, so you need to right-click <img_tag=Icon_RMB:0> on the sprite asset folder and then select the option <strong>Create</strong> (if you don't have a sprite asset folder you can make one from the right-click menu and then create the sprite, or you can simply right-click anywhere in the asset browser and create it). This will create a new sprite asset and open the <a href=""../The_Asset_Editors/Sprites.htm""><strong>sprite editor</strong></a> for you (if the sprite editor does not open, simply double-click <img_tag=LMB_Icon:0> on the new asset):","","URL_EN : https://manual.yoyogames.com/index.htm#t=Quick_Start_Guide%2FCreating_Sprites.htm \n\nURL_JP : https://kuroko137.github.io/gms_manual_jp/index.htm#t=Quick_Start_Guide%2FCreating_Sprites.htm"

It's best to give each sprite a descriptive name so that you can identify at a glance whether a particular asset is a sprite or an object or something else, and many people do this by prefixing or suffixing the resource with the letters "" <span class=""inline"">spr</span>"" - for example, "" <span class=""inline"">spr_Ball</span>"". Note that resource names are limited to using only letters, digits and the underscore symbol ""_"", and the name of all assets must start with a letter, not a number.","","URL_EN : https://manual.yoyogames.com/index.htm#t=Quick_Start_Guide%2FCreating_Sprites.htm \n\nURL_JP : https://kuroko137.github.io/gms_manual_jp/index.htm#t=Quick_Start_Guide%2FCreating_Sprites.htm"
