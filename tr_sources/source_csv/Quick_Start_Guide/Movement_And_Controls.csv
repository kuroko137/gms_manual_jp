We want to convert left/right/up/down into equivalent horizontal and vertical speed values, so to do that we are getting the value of each key and then doing some basic maths on it to get the speed values. This works because if a key is being pressed then the check action or function will return ""1"", and if it's <em>not </em>being pressed, then the function will return 0. So, if - for example - right is being pressed, you have ""1 - 0 = 1"" for the "" <span class=""inline"">_hspd</span>"", and if left is being pressed you have ""0 - 1 = -1"" for the "" <span class=""inline"">_hspd</span>"" (and if they both get pressed then it's ""1 - 1 = 0"", so the instance won't move). Remember, in a GameMaker Studio 2 room, to move right we add to the <span class=""inline"">x </span>position and to move left we subtract, so this code will give us a positive or negative value that we can add or subtract to move horizontally or vertically depending on the keyboard input.","","URL_EN : https://manual.yoyogames.com/index.htm#t=Quick_Start_Guide%2FMovement_And_Controls.htm \n\nURL_JP : https://kuroko137.github.io/gms_manual_jp/index.htm#t=Quick_Start_Guide%2FMovement_And_Controls.htm"
