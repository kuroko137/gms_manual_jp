"Quick_Start_Guide.htm+html.body.p:100-3","We'll go into the specifics of each of the above listed items in the following pages, but that's the general flow of actions required to make a game. The important thing to note here is that your main ""building blocks"" for the game will always be sprites, objects and rooms, although there are a number of subsidiary assets that can also be used to add extra functionality or behaviours to these items (like <strong> <a class=""tooltip"" title=""TITLE_KEY::shaders"">shaders</a></strong>, or <strong> <a class=""tooltip"" title=""TITLE_KEY::timelines"">timelines</a></strong>).","","URL_EN : https://manual.yoyogames.com/index.htm#t=Quick_Start_Guide%2FQuick_Start_Guide.htm \n\nURL_JP : https://kuroko137.github.io/gms_manual_jp/index.htm#t=Quick_Start_Guide%2FQuick_Start_Guide.htm"
"Quick_Start_Guide.htm+html.body.p:103-3","Now, before we go on to explain each of these things in more detail, we'll quickly outline how GameMaker Studio 2 will turn the above building blocks into your game. Basically, everything happens in what is called the <strong>Game Loop</strong>, which has a speed measured in <strong> Frames Per Second</strong>, and one ""frame"" is called a <strong>Step </strong>in GameMaker. The default frames per second (or <strong>FPS</strong>) is 60, meaning that for every second that passes GameMaker Studio 2 will run the game loop 60 times, and each step (loop, frame) a number of events will occur and the game will progress.","","URL_EN : https://manual.yoyogames.com/index.htm#t=Quick_Start_Guide%2FQuick_Start_Guide.htm \n\nURL_JP : https://kuroko137.github.io/gms_manual_jp/index.htm#t=Quick_Start_Guide%2FQuick_Start_Guide.htm"
"Quick_Start_Guide.htm+html.body.p:106-3","To help understand this, let's imagine you have a character that you want to move around the game room. You would create a <em>sprite </em>for that character, then create an <em>object </em>and assign it the sprite, and in the object you'd add an <em>event </em>called the <strong>Step Event</strong>. In this event you would tell it to move right by 2 pixels. You would then place an <strong>instance </strong>of that object into the game room, and when you run the game, the instance will start moving left by 2 pixels every step (the Step Event runs once every game step), so that in 1 second the instance has moved 120 pixels to the right.","","URL_EN : https://manual.yoyogames.com/index.htm#t=Quick_Start_Guide%2FQuick_Start_Guide.htm \n\nURL_JP : https://kuroko137.github.io/gms_manual_jp/index.htm#t=Quick_Start_Guide%2FQuick_Start_Guide.htm"
"Quick_Start_Guide.htm+html.body.p:109-3","In the above example, we talk about telling the object to move to the left, but how do we do that? Well, that's done using a <strong>program </strong>which we write using either <a href=""../Drag_And_Drop/Drag_And_Drop_Index.htm""><strong>Drag and Drop™</strong></a> (the visual scripting language) or <strong><a href=""../GameMaker_Language/GameMaker_Language_Index.htm"">GML</a> </strong>(the <strong>G</strong>ame <strong>M</strong>aker <strong>L</strong>anguage). Which one you use is up to you and the way you want to work, but by using them you are <em>programming </em>your game.
