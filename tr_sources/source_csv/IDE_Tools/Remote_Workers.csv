"Remote_Workers.htm+html.body.p:87-3","When you compile your game, you usually use the ""Local"" worker, which is the computer that GameMaker Studio 2 has been installed on. However under some circumstances you may need to use another computer to build your projects. For example, if you are working on a Mac and you want to build a Windows project, then you would want to configure a <strong>Remote Worker</strong> and have a Windows PC do the build. Essentially, when you use a remote worker, GameMaker Studio 2 will send all the required files from the (local) machine it is running on to the remote worker machine, and then use that machine to build the final executable for the project (either saving it on the remote machine, or returning it to the local machine afterwards). However, before you can use this functionality you will have to have installed certain tools on the build machine and performed some setting up, which we will explain here.","","URL_EN : https://manual.yoyogames.com/index.htm#t=IDE_Tools%2FRemote_Workers.htm \n\nURL_JP : https://kuroko137.github.io/gms_manual_jp/index.htm#t=IDE_Tools%2FRemote_Workers.htm"
