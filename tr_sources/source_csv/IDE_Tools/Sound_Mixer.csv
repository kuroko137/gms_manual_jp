"Sound_Mixer.htm+html.body.p:87-3","While creating any project it can be useful to check and set volumes of groups of sounds together, so that you can be sure that in-game they all sound correct. This can be tricky when you have to open each individual sound editor within the workspace, and so GameMaker Studio 2 permits you to open a<strong> Sound Mixer</strong> window where you can play multiple sounds all from the same place and tweak their volume levels accordingly. This window can be opened from the <a href=""../The_Asset_Editors/Sounds.htm"">Sound Editor</a> (which will add that selected sound to the mixer view) or from the <a href=""../IDE_Navigation/Menus/The_Tools_Menu.htm"">Tools Menu</a>.","","URL_EN : https://manual.yoyogames.com/index.htm#t=IDE_Tools%2FSound_Mixer.htm \n\nURL_JP : https://kuroko137.github.io/gms_manual_jp/index.htm#t=IDE_Tools%2FSound_Mixer.htm"
