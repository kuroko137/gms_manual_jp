  <h1>Your Marketplace Library</h1>
  <p>The <strong>Library </strong>window shows you the packages that you have bought and gives you the option to download them and/or add them to your project.<img alt="{IMG_TXT} Marketplace Library" class="center" src="../../assets/Images/Introduction/Tools_MarketplaceLibrary.png" style="width: 100%; max-width: 1287px;"/>On the left are the different category filters that you can use to see what you have in each one, and then in the middle you have the list of assets in your library. Each one can be selected so that you can see an overview of what it does (on the
    right) and they all have icons to view, download or install the asset package in a project. Note that you have two additional filters at the top of the main window where you can select to see only those assets that have been created specifically for
    GameMaker Studio 2, as well as a filter to show only those assets that you have already downloaded to your machine. You can also refresh the list of assets shown at any time by clicking on the <strong>Refresh </strong>button <img alt="{IMG_TXT} Refresh Page Icon" class="icon" src="../../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_Refresh.png" style="width: 100%; max-width: 22px;"/>.</p>
  <p>To add an asset package to your current project you must first download it by clicking on the <strong>Download </strong>button and when the download has completed, you can click on the <strong>Import </strong>button to add it to your project. Adding
    a package in this way will create an extension within your current project, and ask you to select from the different resources in the asset package to choose which ones you want to add (or you can import all of them). You can also select the option
    <strong>Import all resources to a new project</strong>, and instead of adding the assets to your current project, GameMaker Studio 2 will prompt you to give a new project name and save the asset within that project instead. Note that if you go directly
    to the <strong>Library </strong>from the <strong>Start Page</strong>, you will find most assets cannot be added individually, and instead you will be forced to use the <strong>Add All</strong> button. This is because you do not have a project to add
    the assets to and so GameMaker Studio 2 must create a new project for you to add all the assets in the package to (when you click the Import button, you will be prompted to save the new project with the name of your choice).<img alt="{IMG_TXT} Marketplace Import Resources" class="center" src="../../assets/Images/Introduction/Tools_MarketplaceImport.png" style="width: 100%; max-width: 832px;"/>With the assets added to your Asset Browser, you can now go ahead and use them in your game as you would those assets that you have created yourself. Please note,
    that <strong>assets downloaded from Marketplace are for individual use and cannot be shared to 3rd parties</strong> - although you can back them up and copy them to other locations for safety - unless the asset has a custom EULA that states the contrary.</p>
  <p class="note"><strong>NOTE</strong>: The people that create asset packages for the Marketplace work very hard to create a great resource for you to use, so please consider rating the assets you buy when you have tested them or if you use them. This encourages the
    developer and is also a useful guide for other users as to the quality of the assets available. You can easily rate your downloaded assets from the Library window.</p>
