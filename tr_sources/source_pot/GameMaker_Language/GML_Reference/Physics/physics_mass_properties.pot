"This function can be used to set custom mass and inertia values for a "
"physics enabled instance. Normally the mass, center of mass, and inertia for "
"an instance is calculated using a combination the surface area of the bound "
"fixtures and their density. However in very special occasions you may need "
"to offset the center of mass or change the inertia and that is when you "
"would use this function. Bear in mind that the mass is calculated in real "
"world weight (ie:kilograms) and you should always try and keep values "
"realistic for what you are modelling. So if your physics object is meant to "
"represent a person, their mass would be approximately 70 kilos."

"The center of mass is calculated automatically for you based on the shape of "
"the fixture (or fixtures) you have defined. To get a general idea of where "
"this could be, if you have a sprite that is the same shape as the fixtures "
"you wish to create, then select the \"center origin\" option you will see "
"approximately where the center of mass will be too. However, this may not be "
"correct or you may be looking for a specific effect from your physics "
"object, in which case this function can also be used to change the x and y "
"coordinates for the center of mass. These are <b>local</b> values, so 0,0 is "
"the point at which the fixtures are bound to the instance (the origin of the "
"instance). So a center of mass of -4,0 would shift the center of mass to the "
"left of the origin."

"As for the inertia, this basically defines how resistant the instance is to "
"changes in its direction and velocity, so a higher inertia makes it more "
"resistant and a low inertia makes it less resistant (inertia and mass cannot "
