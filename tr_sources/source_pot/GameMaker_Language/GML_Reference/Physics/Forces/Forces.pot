"In the GameMaker Studio 2 physics world, instances aren't only affected by "
"gravity and collisions, they are also affected by the forces that you choose "
"to apply to them, and knowing the right force to apply is very important "
"when you want to control an instance correctly within the physics "
"simulation. There are two forces which can be used and applied to your "
"fixtures:"
