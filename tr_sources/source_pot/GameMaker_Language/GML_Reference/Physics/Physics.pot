"The integration of a dedicated physics library to GameMaker Studio 2 means "
"that you can now take control over all aspects of the physical behaviour of "
"objects within your game world, particularly collisions and object "
"interaction. The \"traditional\" collision system (which GameMaker Studio 2 "
"defaults to) is a \"reactive\" system, where you check for a collision and "
"<i>then</i> react to that collision with code that you place in individual "
"objects. This is fine for simple games, but when you have a large number of "
"objects and have to code how they all react to different situations in the "
"game world, it quickly becomes obvious that this system is just not enough. "
"That's when you have to turn to the GameMaker Studio 2 physics system."

"The physics system works in a very different way to normal collisions. It is "
"more of a \"passive\" system where you define a series of properties for "
"your objects in the game world, as well as the properties of the game world "
"itself, before any collisions or interactions occur. These coded \"rules\" "
"will then govern the way everything in your game world interacts. In this "
"way, with a few simple code and the correct room setup, you can create very "
"complex interactions between objects and the world which will occur and "
"resolve <i>without</i> you having to code for every single possible outcome."

"The physics system replaces many of the normal instance functions... for "
"example, rather than set a speed and a direction for an instance, if it has "
"been declared as being a fully simulated physical body, you would use a "
"<i>force</i> or <i>impulse</i> to get it to move around in the game world, "
"or if it is not physics enabled you will need to set the x an y positions "
"yourself. This takes a bit of getting used to, so experiment with the "

"number of collisions and collision groups that the physics world has to deal "

"that physics requires some pretty intensive calculations, so limit yourself "

"When setting up collisions, use parents as much as possible since the "
"collision system has a limited number of <i>collision bits</i> available to "
"assign to instances for Box2D to detect collisions. For example, if you have "
"five different wall objects, don't check for five collisions, rather, create "
"a parent object and assign it to the five walls then have ONE collision "
"check with the parent. The physical properties of the objects are <i>not "
"inherited</i> only the collisions. In this way you can keep your game "
