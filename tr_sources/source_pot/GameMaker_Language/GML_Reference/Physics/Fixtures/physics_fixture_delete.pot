"Since once a fixture has been bound to an instance that instance maintains "
"the fixtures properties, we can remove the fixture from memory with this "
"function, particularly if we no longer plan to use it again. Please note "
"that failure to remove fixtures after they are no longer needed may cause a "
"memory leak which will slow down and eventually crash your game, so you "
"should take care to clean up properly after defining and binding fixtures."
