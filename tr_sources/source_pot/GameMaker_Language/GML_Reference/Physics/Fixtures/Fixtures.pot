"Before an instance in GameMaker Studio 2 can have physical properties it "
"must have a fixture assigned to it. A fixture binds a shape or form to the "
"instance and this adds material properties such as density, friction, and "
"restitution. Fixtures can be boxes, circles, polygons or any other simple "
"shape you wish as GameMaker Studio 2 provides functions that enable you to "
"define your own shape point by point, and then once you have your shape you "
"can go ahead and define its physical properties too. These properties are "
"what govern the way the instance with the fixture assigned to it will react "
"with other instance in the physics world and are listed below:"

"<b>Density:</b> A material's density is defined as its mass per unit volume. "
"It is, essentially, a measurement of how tightly matter is crammed together. "
"If you wish your fixture to be <i>static</i> (ie: immovable) then the "
"density should be set to 0, essentially making it infinitely dense. "
"<i>Kinematic</i> objects that move with constant velocity and are not "
"physically affected by collisions are also defined using a density of 0."

"<b>Linear Damping:</b> This is the generalised force that causes a moving "
"object to lose momentum. In the \"real world\" things don't generally happen "
"forever. For example, A paper airplane will fly for a short while but "
"eventually it will fall due to the air friction that acts upon it causing it "
"to slow down. In the physics world that we create such things are difficult "
"to model and so each fixture is given its own linear damping to simulate "
"this type of \"generalised friction\"."
