"There will be certain instances in a physics based game which you want to "
"move around but do not wish to be acted on by forces such as gravity, nor "
"forces incurred by collisions with dynamic objects (think of moving "
"platforms in a platform game, for example). For such objects simply setting "
"the density of a fixture to 0 will mean that the physics will assume that "
"the object is intended to be static. However, should you set the <a href=\""
"../Physics_Variables/phy_speed_x.htm\"><tt>phy_speed_x</tt></a>, <a href=\""
"../Physics_Variables/phy_speed_y.htm\"><tt>phy_speed_y</tt></a> or <a href=\""
"../Physics_Variables/phy_angular_velocity.htm\""
"><tt>phy_angular_velocity</tt></a> variables for an instance that has had "
"such a fixture bound to it, it will be converted into a kinematic object and "
"begin movement. Change the instance from static to kinematic mid-simulation "
"can be expensive in terms of processing (depending on the state of the "
"instances in the physics world) and therefore it is recommended to set the "
"fixture to be kinematic using this function prior to binding it to an "
"instance, so that it will be unaffected by collisions and forces (such as "
"gravity) but may move with constant linear and/or angular velocity."
