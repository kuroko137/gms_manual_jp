"Once we have defined our fixture it has to be bound to an instance. This "
"means that its <i>properties</i> are transferred to the selected instance, "
"<b>not the actual fixture itself</b>, so that one fixture can be bound to "
"multiple instances if all are to have the same properties. You can specify "
"an object index for the target and all instances present in the room at the "
"time will receive that fixtures properties (but not any new instances of the "
"object created later), or you can use the special keywords <i>other</i> and "
"<i>all</i>. You can even specify a parent object and all children instances "
"with that parent will also receive the fixture. Once the fixture has been "
"bound to all the instances that you need, it can be deleted if no longer "
"necessary and the instances with that fixtures properties will not be "
"affected and maintain those properties."
