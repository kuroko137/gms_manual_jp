"When you start a room with physics, or bind fixtures to instances, the "
"fixtures are always considered to be \"awake\"... that is to say, they are "
"processing events and interacting with the surrounding instances. However "
"this can sometimes lead to problems, especially if you have a number of "
"instances with fixtures that are side by side when a room starts (think of a "
"tower made of various instances with fixtures) as with them being \"awake\" "
"they will move and possibly change position due to the sudden start of "
"gravity and collisions affecting them. In these cases you can use this "
"function to flag the fixture as been \"asleep\", in which case it will not "
"be processing anything when it is first created in the room."
