"When using the Steam Cloud to store and synchronise files, you must set up "
"the <i>quota</i> of space that your game will need. This quota is enforced "
"on each Cloud-enabled game, on a per-user-per-game basis, so, for example, "
"if the quota for Game X is 1 megabyte, then each Steam account that owns "
"Game X may store, at most, 1 megabyte of data associated with that game in "
"the Cloud. Any other Cloud-enabled games that the user owns (say, Game Y) "
"will not be affected by the data stored by Game X. The default quota for new "
"Steamworks games is one gigabyte, but you can change this from the "
"Steamworks control panel for your game."

"leave users in a situation where they are unable to fix things and that will "
"lead to a poor experience of your game."
