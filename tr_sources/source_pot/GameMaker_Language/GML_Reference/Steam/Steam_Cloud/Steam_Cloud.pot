"The Steam Cloud provides an easy and transparent remote file storage system "
"for your game. All files written to disk using the GameMaker Studio 2 cloud "
"functions (listed below) will be replicated to the Steam servers after the "
"game exits. If the user then changes computers, the files will then be "
"downloaded to the new computer before the game launches, meaning that the "
"game can then access the files by reading them using the appropriate Steam "
"functions. The Steam Client does the work of ensuring that the files are "
"kept synchronized across all computers the user may be accessing."
