"If the user in <b>Offline Mode</b>, Steam keeps a local cache of the stats "
"and achievement data so that the APIs can be use as normal. Any stats unable "
"to be committed are saved for the next time the user is online. In the event "
"that there have been modifications on more than one machine, Steam will "
"automatically merge achievements and choose the set of stats that has had "
"more progress. Because Steam keeps a local cache of stats data it is not "
"necessary for the game to <i>also</i> keep a local cache of the data on "
"disk, especially as such caches often come in conflict and when they do it "
"looks to a users as if their progress has been reverted, which is a "
"frustrating experience."
