"Since the average stat function can be complex to understand, we will "

"like to track an average statistic, such as \"Points earned per hour\". One "
"approach would be to have two stats: an <i>integer</i> stat, \"TotalPoints\""
", and a <i>float</i> stat \"TotalPlayTimeHours\", and then divide the total "
"points by the total time to get the \"Points per Hour\" value."

"However, once the player has accumulated a significant amount of playtime, "
"the calculated average will change extremely slowly, and the more the user "
"plays the game, the less responsive that average will be. If the user has "
"spent 100 hours playing the game, the calculated average will \"lag\" by "
"about 50 hours of that, and if they increase their skill, they will not see "
"the increase in \"Points Per Hour\" that they expect. To get around that we "
"can use a \"sliding window\" to only calculate the \"Points per hour\" for "
"the last 10 hours played."
