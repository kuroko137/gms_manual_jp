"In GameMaker Studio 2 there are two main ways that can be used to tell the "
"speed at which your game runs. The <a href=\"../General_Game_Control/"
"game_get_speed.htm\"><tt>game speed</tt></a> (as specified in the Game "
"Options) and the <tt>fps</tt> (frames per second). These values are often "
"confused, but basically one is the number of game steps that GameMaker "
"Studio 2 is supposed to be completing in a second (game speed), while the "
"other is the number of CPU steps that GameMaker Studio 2 is actually "
"completing in a second (the real fps), and this value is generally much "
"higher than the game speed, but will drop as your game gets more complex and "
"uses more processing power to maintain the set room speed."
