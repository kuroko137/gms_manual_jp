"The GameMaker Studio 2 networking functions are based on <i>sockets</i>, "
"which is an industry standard on all platforms. With sockets, you have the "
"ability to create both clients and servers using simple GML which allows you "
"to create even a single player game using the client/server model (something "
"which will allow multiplayer to be added easily later)."

"Basically, a socket is an object which can send, receive, connect and listen "
"to <i>ports</i> on the network. These functions deal with just TCP/IP "
"connections, which is what the internet is based on (IPv4 to be more precise)"
". In essence this lets you connect one socket using an IP address (let's say "
"192.168.1.10) to another socket on another IP address (say 192.168.1.11). "
"Once connected, these two sockets can send data back and forth using the "
"<tt>network_send_*</tt> functions (like <a href=\"network_send_packet.htm\""
"><tt>network_send_packet()</tt></a>) and the dedicated asynchronous event "
"that is triggered by them. This async event will generate a <a href=\"../"
"Data_Structures/DS_Maps/DS_Maps.htm\">DS map</a> containing the data "
"received as well as other details, and you can find the complete details in "
"the section on the <a href=\"../../../The_Asset_Editors/Object_Properties/"
"Async_Events/Networking.htm\">Network Async Event</a>."

"Instead of programs having to read and deal with every bit of network "
"traffic coming into a machine, IP addresses also deal with ports, which are "
"numbered from 0 to 65535. This allows each program to get only the packets "
"of data that it's interested in, and not everything that has been sent by "
"every program. This also saves considerable CPU time, as it seriously cuts "
"down on data processing, so with GameMaker Studio 2 you can also “listen” to "
"ports. So, a server will create a socket, and then bind it to a specific "
"port to listen to. It will then get notified of connections, disconnections "
"and data transfers from that socket."

"It is worth noting that if you are creating a project for the HTML5 target, "
"then you will not be able to use the server create functions due to browser "
"restrictions and will have to write your own server for this platform using "
"something like <strong>Electron </strong>or <strong>NodeJS</strong>. Also "
"note that if your game is cross platform and you anticipate connecting to an "
"HTML5 instance of the game from a server running on a mobile or desktop "
"device, then your server can only communicate to the HTML5 instance using "
"the Web Socket protocol (this is done using the constant "
"<tt>network_socket_ws</tt> - see <a href=\"network_create_server.htm\""
"><tt>network_create_server()</tt></a> for more information). This means that "
"your server may have to create two sockets on different ports, one to "
"connect to non HTML5 targets (Android, Windows, etc...) and one to connect "
"to the HTML5 target."
