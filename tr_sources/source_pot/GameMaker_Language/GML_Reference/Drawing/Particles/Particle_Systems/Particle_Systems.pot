"Before you can create particles you need to create a particle system. This "
"is a \"container\" where you place your particles and emitters (if you need "
"them) ready for use, and you can put as many or as few particles into any "
"one system as you think necessary, and you can have as many systems as you "
"think necessary too. However, it is always better to keep this number as "
"small as possible due to the fact that each system, emitter and particle "
"takes up memory and having too many of them may slow your game down or cause "
"problems. For example, if you need some effects to appear above instances, "
"and other effects to appear beneath instances, you would create two systems "
"and set their depths to get the desired effect, with all particles that are "
"added to each system being drawn at the depth you specify."

"Since a particle system is a dynamically created resource, you must create "
"it and store the returned index in a variable to reference the system in all "
"further function calls, and it is very important that you also destroy the "
"system when it is no longer needed or else you will have a memory leak that "
"will slow down and eventually crash your game. It is also worth noting that "
"particle systems will live on forever after they are created, even if the "
"index is no longer stored. So even if you change room or restart the game, "
"the systems and the particles will remain, and be visible, in all further "
"rooms so you better make sure you destroy them once you no longer need them."
