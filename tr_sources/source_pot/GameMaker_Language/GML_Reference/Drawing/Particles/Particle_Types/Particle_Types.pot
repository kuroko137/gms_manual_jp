"Particles are the graphic effects that can be created by the use of particle "
"systems in a game. The particles that you define using these functions can "
"be used in any system that you create and the normal procedure would be to "
"define all your particles once at the start of a game and store their index "
"values in global variables. These global variables can then be used to "
"burst, emit or create particles at any time throughout the game. You can "
"also create, use and then destroy particles as needed if memory is an issue "
"or if you wish many different types but only at specific points in your "
"game. Whatever you choose, particles are a very versatile resource!"
