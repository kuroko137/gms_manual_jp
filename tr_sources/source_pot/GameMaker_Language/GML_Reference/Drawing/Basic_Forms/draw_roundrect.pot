"With this function you can draw either an outline of a rounded rectangle or "
"a filled rounded rectangle where the (x1,y1) position is the top left corner "
"and the (x2,y2) position is the bottom right corner. You can define how "
"precise the drawing of the corners is with the function <a href="
"\"draw_set_circle_precision.htm\"><tt>draw_set_circle_precision()</tt></a>, "
"but this function uses a fixed radius for them (should you need to change "
"the corner radius, use the function <a href=\"draw_roundrect_ext.htm\""
"><tt>draw_roundrect_ext()</tt></a>). Please note that the rectangle being "
"drawn may need different values (+/-1 on the x, y, or width or height) to be "
"drawn with the desired dimensions due to differences across the various "
"supported platforms."

"<b>NOTE</b>: If you are wanting to draw a shape using a shader, you should "
"be aware that most shaders expect the following inputs: vertex, texture, "
"Colour. However, when using this function, only vertex and colour data are "
"being passed in, and so the shader may not draw anything (or draw something "
"but not correctly). If you need to draw shapes in this way then the shader "
"should be customised with this in mind."
