"GameMaker Studio 2 has a whole collection of functions available for drawing "
"different forms and shapes. These functions should only ever be used in the "
"draw event of an instance (you <i>can</i> use them elsewhere but you won't "
"see anything!) and create purely graphic effects, which means that they do "
"not generate collision events as those can only be done through the sprite "
"or collision mask that has been assigned to an instance. All these functions "
"are affected by the current draw colour, alpha and blend mode (see the "
"section on <a href=\"../Colour_And_Alpha/Colour_And_Alpha.htm\">Colour</a>)."
