"This function will draw an arrow from point (x1,y1) to point (x2,y2). The "
"stem of the arrow is drawn along these points with the actual arrow head "
"being drawn at the end, where the size of the arrowhead is defined by the "
"argument \"size\" and is calculated as being part of the stem so that the "
"end point is always aligned with the position defined by x2,y2. The width of "

"<b>NOTE</b>: If you are wanting to draw a shape using a shader, you should "
"be aware that most shaders expect the following inputs: vertex, texture, "
"Colour. However, when using this function, only vertex and colour data are "
"being passed in, and so the shader may not draw anything (or draw something "
"but not correctly). If you need to draw shapes in this way then the shader "
"should be customised with this in mind."
