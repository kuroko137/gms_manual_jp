"With this function you can get GameMaker Studio 2 to draw a path to the "
"screen. The path will be drawn as a simple line, and can be either relative "
"to the calling instance or at the absolute position it was created at in the "
"path editor or through code. This function is extremely useful when "
"debugging dynamic paths (for example, those created for instances with the "

"<b>NOTE</b>: If you are wanting to draw a shape using a shader, you should "
"be aware that most shaders expect the following inputs: vertex, texture, "
"Colour. However, when using this function, only vertex and colour data are "
"being passed in, and so the shader may not draw anything (or draw something "
"but not correctly). If you need to draw shapes in this way then the shader "
"should be customised with this in mind."
