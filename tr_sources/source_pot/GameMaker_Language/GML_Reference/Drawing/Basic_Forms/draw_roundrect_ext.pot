"With this function you can draw either an outline of a rounded rectangle or "
"a filled rounded rectangle where the (x1,y1) position is the top left corner "
"and the (x2,y2) position is the bottom right corner. You must also supply "
"radius values for the x and y axis (in pixels) and the corners will be "
"rounded by these amounts. You can define how precise the drawing of the "
"corners is with the function <a href=\"draw_set_circle_precision.htm\""
"><tt>draw_set_circle_precision()</tt></a>. Please note that the rectangle "
"being drawn may need different values (+/-1 on the x, y, or width or height) "
"to be drawn with the desired dimensions due to differences across the "
"various supported platforms."

"<b>NOTE</b>: If you are wanting to draw a shape using a shader, you should "
"be aware that most shaders expect the following inputs: vertex, texture, "
"Colour. However, when using this function, only vertex and colour data are "
"being passed in, and so the shader may not draw anything (or draw something "
"but not correctly). If you need to draw shapes in this way then the shader "
"should be customised with this in mind."
