"With this function you can choose to enable (<tt>true</tt>) or disable "
"(<tt>false</tt>) the draw event for <b>all instances in the game</b>, thus "
"giving you control over how and when things are draw, useful if you wish to "
"implement a \"frame skip\" technique. Note that this doesn't just prevent "
"instances drawing to the screen, it suppresses the draw event completely "
"meaning that care should be taken since any game logic that is present in "
"that event will not be run either. One important thing to understand about "
"this function is that if you call it right at the start of the game, before "
"the initial frame is rendered (ie: the Create Event of the first object in "
"the first room of the game), then the game window <b>will not be rendered</"
"b>. This could be useful for online projects that require a server which "
"doesn't need to render anything."
