"In the normal draw events, GameMaker Studio 2 doesn't actually draw directly "
"to the screen, but rather draws to a <b>surface</b> called the "
"<i>application surface</i>. This surface is basically a blank \"canvas\" "
"that can then later be manipulated before being drawn to the screen when "
"needed, and in most cases GameMaker Studio 2 handles this for you (although "
"you can also manipulate it yourself in code for shaders, scaling and many "
"other things - further details are given below)."

"However, apart from this application surface, you can also create your own "
"surfaces and use them to create stunning or subtle special effects in your "
"game. For example, you can use surfaces to \"catch\" instances, which can "
"then be destroyed, and in this way you can create a decal effect where the "
"sprite for the instance is displayed on the surface as if it still existed, "
"permitting graphical effects like debris, blood, etc... without any real "
"processing overhead. Another thing you can do with surfaces is use them as "
"textures to be manipulated, or to create sprites \"on the fly\", or to "
"create complex overlays. in fact, the uses for surfaces are endless!"

"First, you should realise that surfaces (<i>except</i> the application "
"surface) are \"volatile\". This means that if the device or window loses "
"focus or is minimised (good examples are when you ALT +Tab to different "
"window and back again on Windows, or on an Android device when the app loses "
"focus due to a call) then the surface <strong>may be destroyed</strong>. "
"This is because it is stored <em>only</em> in the texture memory (<a class="
"\"tooltip\" title=\"TITLE_KEY::VRAM\">VRAM</a>) and may be overwritten when "
"the target platform needs that memory for something else which means that "

"Second, you should note that surfaces can require large quantities of VRAM "

"Third, you should <b>only create surfaces in the draw event</b>. If you "
"create a surface in the Create Event of an instance, you could potentially "
"get the <i>same</i> index as the <tt>application_surface</tt>. This can then "
"cause lots of problems and confusion as you think you are using your own "
"surface, but you are actually using the current render target. You should "
"also always try to limit <i>drawing</i> to a surface in the draw event too, "
"since due to the optimised way in which GameMaker Studio 2 draws to the "
"screen, it is recommended that you keep all draw functions <i>within the "
"draw event</i> - this includes clearing a surface when it is first created, "
"etc... Drawing to a surface outside of the draw event is possible and may "
"even be necessary for some effects, but it's not how it <em>should</em> be "

"Fourth, when drawing to a surface manually, the surface is <i>always</i> at "
"the position of (0,0). This means that you may need to convert <em>absolute</"

"example, if you have a camera-sized surface and wish to draw something that "
"is currently visible in the camera to that surface, you should subtract the "
"camera view x and y coordinates from the actual x and y coordinates to get a "
"relative position to the surface (0,0) position. So, the code would look "

"Finally, it is worth noting that drawing to a surface will take into "
"consideration the coloour <em>and</em> the alpha component of each pixel, "
"both from the surface itself and also from what is being drawn to it. This "
