"A buffer is a region of physical memory used to temporarily hold data while "

"However, if you write another piece of data, also 1 byte in size, then do a "
"<tt>buffer_tell</tt>, you'll get an offset of 5 as the alignment has \"padded"

"written to, so if you do a <tt>buffer_tell</tt> after you write something, "
"it'll return the current write position which immediately follows the data "
