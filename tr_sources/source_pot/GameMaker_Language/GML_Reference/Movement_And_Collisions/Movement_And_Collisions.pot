"GameMaker Studio 2<span> has a great number of ways in which you can move "
"instances around within your game room, ranging from setting speed and "
"direction vectors to simply \"placing\" an instance at a specific position, "
"as well as using more sophisticated methods like path-finding. There are "
"also a good number of different methods for detecting collisions between two "
"instances, and which you choose will depend largely on the type of game you "
"are making and the exact situation that you need to use the collision "
"functions in. The following sections cover all of this and list all the "
"functions related to movement, path-finding and collisions:</span>"
