"The <tt>mp_potential_</tt> functions do their work using a number of "
"parameters that can be changed using this function. Globally the method "
"works as follows: it first tries to move straight towards the goal, looking "
"a number of steps ahead which can be set with the parameter \"ahead\" ("
"default value is 3). Reducing this value means that the instance will start "
"changing direction later as it doesn't \"see\" as far ahead, and increasing "
"it means it will start changing direction earlier. If this check leads to a "
"collision then it starts looking at directions more to the left and to the "
"right of the ideal, straight-line direction. It does this in steps of size "
"\"rotstep\" (default value is 10), and reducing this gives the instance more "
"movement possibilities but will be slower as it needs more processing power."

"The parameter \"maxrot\" is a bit more difficult to explain! The instance "
"has a current direction of movement, and maxrot (default value is 30) "
"indicates how much it is allowed to vary its direction either side of that "
"current direction in one step. So even if it can move e.g. straight to the "
"goal it will only do so if it does not violate this maximal change of "
"direction. If you make maxrot a large value then the instance can change "
"direction a lot in each step, and this will make it easier to find a short "
"path but the path will be uglier and less natural. If you make the value "
"smaller then the path will be smoother but it might take longer detours (and "
"sometimes even fail to find the goal). Finally, When no step can be made the "
"behavior depends on the value of the parameter \"onspot\". If onspot is true "
"(the default value), then the instance will rotate on its spot by the amount "
"indicated with \"maxrot\" and if it is false it will not move at all. "
"Setting it to false is useful for e.g. cars but reduces the chance of the "
"instance finding a path."
