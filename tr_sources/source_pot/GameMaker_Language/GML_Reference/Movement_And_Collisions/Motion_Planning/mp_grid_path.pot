"With this function you can create a path that will navigate from a start "

"defined, avoiding any obstacles that have already been added into the grid. "
"The xstart and ystart arguments indicate the start of the path in room "
"coordinates, while xgoal, ygoal arguments indicate the destination. You can "
"also select either horizontal/vertical movement only, or allow full diagonal "
"movements by specifying true in the allowdiag argument. The function returns "
"either true (it succeeded in finding a path) or false (it failed) as well as "
"setting the chosen path. In the following image, you can see how this all "

"As you can see, the \"pipe\" objects have been added into the grid, meaning "
"that any path created has to go around them. There are two paths created in "
"the image, one (green) has been made with diagonals allowed and the other "
"(red) without. The difference between the two is pretty obvious with the "
"green path appearing much more \"elegant\" and direct, but it all depends "
"what use you are going to put them to which one you prefer. Note that the "
"path is independent of the current instance - it is a path through the grid, "
"not a path for a specific instance, even though a specific instance may have "
"the variable that stores the path index. You may also need to debug these "
"paths to see how they are made and interact within the game environment, in "
