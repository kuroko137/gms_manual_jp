"In many games you want opponents, NPC's, enemies etc... to interact with the "
"player and show certain intelligence when moving around ie: you want them to "
"avoid obstacles, plan routes and generally not bump into everything in their "
"path! To aid in this GameMaker Studio 2 has a series of functions that deal "
"with motion planning. Note that while these are designed for things like "
"game enemies, they can be used for all sorts of things like creating a "
"smooth way to introduce text, or to create transitions etc... However, "
"whatever you choose to use from the list below in your game, it should be "
"noted that in many situations a single function set will not give you a "
"perfect solution and that you will have to \"mix and match\" the functions, "
"using one or the other depending on the situation within your game."

"This kind of function tries to compute a collision-free path for the "
"instance. Once this path has been computed you can assign it to the instance "
"to move towards the goal. The computation of the path will take some time "
"but after that the execution of the path will be fast. Of course this is "
"only valid if the situation has not changed in the meantime. For example, if "
"obstacles change you possibly will need to recompute the path. Again notice "

"The global idea is as follows - First of all we create a grid that covers "
"the room (or the relevant part of it). You can choose to use a fine grid, "
"which will be slower, or a coarse grid, but both of them should be based on "
"the resolution of the room so that the path-finding is as accurate as "
"possible. For example, if you have a room that is 400x200 pixels, you can "
"have a grid resolution of 40, or 20, or 10... it all depends on how accurate "
"you need the path to be and how much processing you want GameMaker to do to "
"generate it."

"Next, for all relevant objects that we want to avoid we need to determine "

"Finally we specify a start position and a goal position, both of which "
"<i>must</i> lie in free cells, and the function then computes the shortest "
"path possible between these two positions. The path will run between the "
"centers of all free cells, so if the cells are large enough so that the "
"instance placed at its center will lie completely inside it this will be "
"successful. This path is then assigned to the instance to follow using the "
"<a href=\"../../Asset_Management/Paths/Paths.htm\"><tt>path_*</tt></a> "
"functions. You should realise how important cell size is for this as the "
"cells must be large enough so that the moving object placed with its origin "
"on the center of a cell will lie <i>completely</i> inside the cell. (Be "
"careful about the position of the origin of the object. Also realize that "
"you can shift the path if the origin of the object is not in its center!) On "
"the other hand, the smaller the cells the more possible paths exist. If you "
"make cells too large, openings between obstacles may get closed because all "
"cells intersect an obstacle."
