"set as true. As you can see the, green instance has only marked the grid "
"squares it \"touches\" as forbidden, due to the fact that its sprite mask is "
"also set to precise. However the second instance has marked other cells too "
"which don't <i>appear</i> to be touching. This is because the sprite mask is "
"<b>not</b> set to precise, meaning that even if you are using the precise "
