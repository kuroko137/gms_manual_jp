"This function will draw the specified MP grid (as defined by <a href="
"\"mp_grid_create.htm\"><span class=\"inline\">mp_grid_create()</span></a>), "
"marking free cells as green and forbidden cells as red. This function is "
"essential as a debug tool but it should be noted that it is <i>very</i> slow "
"and only works when used in the <b>draw</b> event of the instance, and that "
"you can set the draw alpha to change the opacity of the grid, permitting you "
"to draw it as an overlay and see what is actually in the room at the same "
