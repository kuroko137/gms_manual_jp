"Setting this variable will instruct GameMaker Studio 2 to use the designated "
"sprite as a cursor (basically setting it to the current mouse x/y position "
"every step). The default value is -1 which is no sprite for the cursor, but "
"you can assign any sprite index from the game assets or that has been "
"imported from an external resource. Please note that there is no way to "
"control the animation speed or image_index, so if the sprite has sub-images, "
"these will be cycled at the same speed as the room speed. To remove the "
"cursor sprite, you can set this variable to -1 again."

"window_set_cursor.htm\"><tt>window_set_cursor()</tt></a> and set it to the "
