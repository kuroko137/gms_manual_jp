"In order for your games to work properly on mobile devices with a touch "

"certain things when they are touched by the user. This is done by assigning "
"a \"virtual Key\" to an internally mapped standard keyboard key and then "

"position rather than room position and so the x/y values are absolute, based "
"on the display size. This means that you don't need to worry about the use "
"of views or the relative room coordinates, and can simply define the keys in "
