"The GameMaker Studio 2 <strong>Garbage Collector</strong> exists because "
"methods can be passed on the stack and left unreferenced, as can structs and "
"a few other things, which in turn would cause a memory leak if they weren't "
"\"cleaned up\" in some way. This is where the garbage collector comes in and "
"it will run in the background of the game, collecting anything that's been "
"de-referenced and maintaining an optimal memory usage. When we talk about "
"something being de-referenced, we generally refer to any struct or function "
"which isn't connected (it doesn't have to be directly, but through a chain "
"of other variables) to a <strong>global </strong>variable or an "
"<strong>object instance variable</strong>. Also note that functions defined "
"in scripts in the IDE are also not collected, as they are implicitly made "
"global."

"<b>NOTE</b>: Please note that things like surfaces, data structures, buffers "
"and other dynamic resources are <b>not</b> garbage collected and have their "
"own <tt>destroy</tt> functions to clean up the memory associated with them. "
"As a rule of thumb, if anything you create at run time has a <tt>destroy</"
"tt> function then it won't be garbage collected and you will have to deal "
"with it yourself in code. The exceptions to this are sequences, animation "
"curves and instances, which also require the garbage collector, <b>but still "
"need to have their destroy function called</b>."

"The garbage collection which GameMaker Studio 2 uses is \"generational\". "
"This means that, in order to reduce the work that must be done every frame, "
"objects are divided into \"generations\". New objects are created in "
"generation 0 and they are moved into older generations as they themselves "
"age. The general idea is that objects which hang around for a while don't "
"need to be continuously tested to see if they should be deleted, but can be "
"checked less frequently (note that \"objects\" here refers to anything that "
"can be garbage collected and <i>not</i> general object instances as defined "
"in the Asset Browser). Note that while the checking system is generational, "
"the actual checks are done in an \"incremental\" way, such that instead of "
"clearing up potentially thousands of objects from a generation in a single "
"frame - causing a large spike in CPU use and potentially affecting the "
"gameplay - each generation will be checked and if required the cleaning will "
"be spread over multiple frames so the garbage collector runs more frequently "
"but does less work each frame it is collecting (you can set the target time "
"for the garbage collector to spend on each frame using the function <span "
"class=\"inline\"><a href=\"gc_target_frame_time.htm\""
">gc_target_frame_time()</a></span>)."
