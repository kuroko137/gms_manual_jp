"GameMaker Studio 2 offers you the possibility to \"switch off\" instances so "
"that they are no longer processed in any way. Technically they don't really "
"exist anymore, except as a pointer within the deactivation process itself, "
"which means that a deactivated instance cannot be manipulated or changed in "
"any way at all until it is re-activated again. So, these functions should be "
"used with great care as they can cause problems when not used properly, "
"particularly with persistent objects, as a persistent object that has been "
"deactivated will not be moved to the next room unless it is re-activated "
"first (effectively deleting it from the game). Note too that "
"<strong>activation and deactivation are not instantaneous</strong>, and an "
"instance that has had its state changed in this way will not be considered "
"to be active/inactive until the <em>end of the event in which the function "
"was called</em>."

"It is normally not necessary to deactivate instances every step of your game "
"and this can actually cause your game to have performance issues. Instead it "
"is recommended that you only run these functions every few steps in an alarm "
"(for example), or if the camera view has changed position, and it is "
"especially important that you do not use these functions in the draw event "
"as this can lead to serious errors in your game."
