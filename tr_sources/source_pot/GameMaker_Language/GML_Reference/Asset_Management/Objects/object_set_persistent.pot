"With this function you can set the persistence of a specific object. A "
"persistent object is \"carried over\" from room to room and maintains its "
"properties at all times (for more information on persistence see the section "
"on the <a href=\"../../../../The_Asset_Editors/Objects.htm\">Object "
"Editor</a>). Setting the persistence of the object means that all instances "
"of this object that are created <i>after the persistence has been changed</"
"i> will be created persistent, while instances that are already in the room "
"may not be affected."

"When you create an instance with persistence enabled in a room, it will be "
"assigned a layer or a depth (depending on which function you used to create "
"the instance of the object). When the room is changed, and if the following "
"room does <i>not</i> have a layer with the same name or depth as the one "
"assigned, then a new layer will be created for the instance that is "
"persisting across the rooms. If you gave a named layer when the instance was "
"created, then the new layer will also be named the same as original layer, "
"while if you assigned a depth to the instance then the new layer will be "
"named \"<tt>_layer_XXX</tt>\", where \"XXX\" is a hex value used to give the "
"layer a unique name. These layers will be removed from the room on Room End. "
"Another thing to note about layers and persistent instances is that if you "
"have assigned the instance a named layer on creation, and there is another "
"layer in the following rooms with the same name, then the persisted instance "
"will be assigned to the layer with the same name <i>regardless of the depth "
"of the layer</i>. Finally, if a persisted instance moves to a room with a "
"layer at the same depth as the instance was created on, it will <i>not</i> "
"be assigned to this layer, but instead a new layer will be created at the "
"same depth (following the naming convention explained previously)."
