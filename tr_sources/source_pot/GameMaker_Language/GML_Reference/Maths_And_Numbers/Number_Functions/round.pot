"Just as it says, <tt>round()</tt> takes a real number and rounds it up or "
"down to the nearest integer. In the special case where the number supplied "
"is exactly a half-integer (1.5, 17.5, -2.5, etc), the number will be rounded "
"to the nearest <i>even</i> value, for example, 2.5 would be rounded to 2, "
"while 3.5 will be rounded to 4. This type of rounding is called <i>bankers "
"rounding</i> and over large numbers of iterations or when using floating "
"point maths, it gives a statistically better rounding than the more "
"traditional \"round up if over .5 and round down otherwise\" approach."

"What this means is that if the fraction of a value is 0.5, then the rounded "
"result is the <i>even integer</i> nearest to the input value. So, for "
"example, 23.5 becomes 24, as does 24.5, while -23.5 becomes -24, as does -"
"24.5. This method treats positive and negative values symmetrically, so is "
"therefore free of sign bias, and, more importantly, for reasonable "
"distributions of values, the expected (average) value of the rounded numbers "
"is the same as that of the original numbers."
