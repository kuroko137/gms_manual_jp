"A basic description of a <strong>global </strong>variable is one that, once "
"declared, it belongs to no instance in particular and yet can be accessed by "
"all. Just like <a href=\"Local_Variables.htm\">local variables</a>, global "
"variables must be declared using an identifier, but unlike a local variable, "
"a global variable remains in memory <em>until the end of the game</em>. So, "
"you can create a global variable to keep track of (for example) the number "
"of bullets that the player has and then just update this variable at "
"different points in the game, form any instance or function and at any time. "
"Essentially, a global variable does not belong to any specific instance and "
"can be accessed, changed and used by all instances, and any changes made to "
"the variable are \"global\", in that all instances using the variable will "
"be affected by the change. Let's have a look at an example:"

"With global variables we can change values and see those changes reflected "
"in all instances of the objects that reference this variable. As with "
"<i>local</i> variables you have to take care not to name your global "
"variables the same as any instance variables as that may cause you problems "
"and make bugs creep into your games due to variable overlap, which can be a "
"difficult issue to debug sometimes. In general you should have a single "
"object that declares all your global variables at the very start of the game "
"(for example, in the <a href=\"../../../The_Asset_Editors/Object_Properties/"
"Other_Events.htm\">Room Start Event</a> of the first object instance placed "
"in the first room of the game) or a single <a href=\"../Script_Functions."
