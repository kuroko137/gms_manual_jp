"In the sections dedicated to <a href=\"Variables_And_Variable_Scope.htm\""
">variables</a> you found out how to create and use variables within a single "
"instance, or on a global scope, but what happens if you want one instance to "
"access a variable in another, different instance? There are many cases when "
"you may want to do this, for example in a collision with a bullet object, "
"you may want to find out how much damage the bullet does by accessing a "
"variable in the bullet, or you might want to stop the motion of all the "
"balls in a puzzle, or you might want to move the main character to a "

"across in any game. Thankfully the GameMaker Language comes equipped with "
