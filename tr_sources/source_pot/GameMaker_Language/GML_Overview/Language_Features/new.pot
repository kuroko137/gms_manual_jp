"The <tt>new</tt> operator can be used to create a struct with a function "
"which is called with the given arguments. The function can then populate the "
"struct with variables from the arguments - much like the create event of an "
"instance will set the initial variables for the instance - and then the "
"<tt>new</tt> operator will return the struct. Before using this operator it "
"is important to note that the function given <i>must be flagged as a "
"<tt>constructor</tt> function</i> otherwise the <tt>new</tt> operator will "
"not create the struct (the code example below shows this, and for more "
