"While great care has been taken when creating GameMaker Studio 2 to ensure "
"that it is a stable and reliable tool, there is always the possibility that "
"an issue could occur given the nature of the software and the operating "
"systems it runs on. In most cases any errors will be caught by GameMaker "
"Studio 2 and you may be prompted to save your projects and then close and "
"restart the program. If this happens then we would request that you file a "
"bug with the YoYo Games helpdesk. You can do this using the <strong>Report A "
"Bug</strong> option from the <a href=\"../IDE_Navigation/Menus/The_Help_Menu."
"htm\">Help Menu</a> and, we ask that when doing so you give as much "
"information as possible and also supply a link to the GameMaker Studio 2 "
