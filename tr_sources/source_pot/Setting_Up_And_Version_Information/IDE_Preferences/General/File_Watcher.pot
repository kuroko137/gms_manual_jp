"The <strong>File Watcher</strong> is the name given to the part of the IDE "
"that watches the files related to a project for any changes due to external "
"software (ie: editing an image in an external editor) or due to internal "
"changes like editing a script asset. In general, these settings shouldn't "
"need to be edited, but on some systems - like those that use an SSD as the "
"save drive for the project files - the file watcher may be informing you of "
"changes when you do things like simply saving the project or whenever you "
"edit any project asset, in which case you may need to change these settings."
