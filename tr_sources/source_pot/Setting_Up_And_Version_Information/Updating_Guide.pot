"The GameMaker Studio 2 IDE will periodically check for updates and then "

"are some updates that include important fixes or improvements that cannot be "

"GameMaker Studio 2 is more than just an IDE and has a number of different "
"runtime tools that it uses behind the scenes to build you games for the "
"different target platforms available. These tools are mainly the different "
"runners and compilers that each platform requires, and you can actually have "
"several of each at any one time. What this means is that you can \"pick and "
"choose\" which compiler version and which runner version to use should you "
"have found any issues with the current one or are aiming at a very specific "
"target version or platform. Tools will automatically update when there is a "
"new version available, but you can then use the <strong>Runtime Feeds "
"Preferences</strong> to select which ones you actually want to use. For more "
"information on runtime updates please see <a href=\"IDE_Preferences"
"/Runtime_Feed_Preferences.htm\">Preferences - Runtime Feeds</a>."
