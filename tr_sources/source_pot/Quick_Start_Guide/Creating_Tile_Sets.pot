"<strong>Tile Sets</strong> are created from sprites, but they are also "
"classified as a separate asset type since the way that GameMaker Studio 2 "
"handles them is a bit different to both sprites and objects. So, a tile set "
"is a collection of tiles created together in one sprite, and a tile is "
"simply a graphical resource that gets added to a GameMaker Studio 2 room as "
"part of a <strong> <a class=\"tooltip\" title=\"TITLE_KEY::tile_map\">tile "
"map</a></strong>. These tile maps are then drawn to the screen with very "
"little CPU/GPU processing, making them ideal for designing any static items "
"in levels."

"To make processing tiles so fast, they do have certain restrictions, with "
"the most basic one being that they can <strong>only be rectangular or "
"square</strong> (if you want anything other than a this, then you'll need to "
"create a regular sprite and use the <em>Asset Layer</em> in the room editor, "
"but we'll discuss that in the later section on <a href=\"Rooms.htm\""
">rooms</a>). Other restrictions include the fact that they can only be "
"rotated by 90°, or mirrored or flipped, and they can only be animated with "
"frames that number a <strong>power of 2</strong> (ie: 2, 4, 8, 16, etc...)."

"<strong>Notice that the very first tile is blank in that image</strong>. The "
"way that the tile map for the room is stored in GameMaker Studio 2 means "
"that first tile will always need to be blank as it's essentially the \"delete"
"\" tile or the \"empty space\" tile (this \"blank\" tile will have an "
"<strong>index </strong>value of 0 - tiles are indexed with a value that "
"starts at 0 and counts up from left to right, top to bottom). So, when "
"creating your tile sets, the top left corner tile will always need to be "
"empty in this way. Also note that while the image above shows a full wall "
"tile set with 47 tiles, you may not need so many as you can rotate and flip "
"tiles when placing them in the room editor later."
