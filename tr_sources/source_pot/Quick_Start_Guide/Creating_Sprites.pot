"Now that you <a href=\"What_Is_Programming_.htm\">know what a program is</"
"a>, it's time to look at some of the different <strong>assets </strong>that "
"can be used in GameMaker Studio 2 to make your game. To start with, we'll "
"look at <strong>sprites</strong>, which are generally one of the first "
"things you'll need when making any project. As explained in the section on "
"<a href=\"../Introduction/The_Asset_Browser.htm\">The Asset Browser</a>, a "
"sprite is an image that can be animated (although it doesn't have to be) and "
"then drawn to the screen. In general a sprite will be associated with an "
"object, but you can draw sprites on their own, either from code or in the "
"room editor <strong>Asset Layer</strong> (we'll talk about this in more "
"detail later, in the section on <a href=\"Rooms.htm\">rooms</a>). You can "
"also create a sprite to be used as a <a class=\"tooltip\" title=\"TITLE_KEY::"
"tile_sets\">tile sets</a>, but we'll explore that option in a later section "

"As you can see, the top left of the window has a field for the <strong>Name "

"best to give each sprite a descriptive name so that you can identify at a "
"glance whether a particular asset is a sprite or an object or something "
"else, and many people do this by prefixing or suffixing the resource with "
"the letters \" <span class=\"inline\">spr</span>\" - for example, \" <span "
"class=\"inline\">spr_Ball</span>\". Note that resource names are limited to "
