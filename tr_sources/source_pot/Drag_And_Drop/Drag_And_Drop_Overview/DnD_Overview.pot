"Drag and Drop™ (DnD™) is a visual scripting tool that can be used to create "
"your games without actually typing any code. That's not to say that you "
"aren't programming code when you use DnD™, as you are, only that your code "
"is created and presented in a visual way using \"blocks\" of <strong>actions "
"</strong>rather than text. Actions are simple <a class=\"tooltip\" title="
"\"TITLE_KEY::expression\">expression</a><span class=\"glossextra\"></span> "
"or <a class=\"tooltip\" title=\"TITLE_KEY::statement\">statement</a><span "
"class=\"glossextra\"></span> that can be \"chained\" together to have an "
"instance of an object do something when placed in a room. For example, you "
"could have an action in a <strong>Create Event</strong> to move an instance "
"in a random direction, and another action in a <strong>Collision Event</"
"strong> to make it bounce off the things it collides with (for more "
