"In your projects you can have multiple different particle <i>types</i>, each "
"with their own properties like direction and colour, etc... which are set "
"using the different particle type actions. However you first need to create "
"a <b>particle type</b> using this action, which essentially allocates a "
"small amount of memory to hold all the particle details so that you can use "
"the particles at any time in the future. You give a variable to hold the "
"unique ID value for the particle type, and then in all future actions "
"relating to this particle you can call the variable. You can choose to flag "
"this variable as being a temporary local variable, but that will mean that "
"it is discarded at the end of the action script or event, meaning that the "
"particle type will still exist but leave you without any means to access it, "
"so care must be taken when using this (in general particle types will never "
"need to be stored in a temporary local variable, but for certain things, "
"like drawing particles to a surface, it may be required)."

"<b>NOTE</b>: A particle type, once created, remains resident in the system "
"memory for the duration of the game, and so if you need to recreate it at "
"any point (for example, if you call the <a href=\"../Game/Restart_Game.htm\""
">Restart Game</a> action), then you <b>must destroy the current particle "
"type</b> otherwise you get a memory leak. This happens when a resource is "
"added to memory and then \"de-referenced\", meaning that GameMaker Studio 2 "
"has no way to interact with that resource any more. This leads to the memory "
"being clogged by inaccessible resources which in turn can cause issues with "
"your game. To destroy a particle type when no longer required use the action "
"<a href=\"Destroy_Particle_Type.htm\">Destroy Particle Type</a>."

"You can also set the <b>blend mode</b> to be used for the particles. By "
"default they will be drawn with a \"normal\" blend mode, so colours will not "
"be modified by what was drawn underneath the particle, however with blending "
"flagged, they will be drawn using <i>additive</i> blending, which means that "
"things will be drawn with changes to the colours based on what was drawn "
"under the particle. Additive blending gives very bright and \"glowing\" "
"effects, and is ideal for explosions, lasers, fire, etc... while normal "
"blending is better for things like rain, smoke, or debris effects. The image "
"below shows the same effect with additive on and with additive off:"
