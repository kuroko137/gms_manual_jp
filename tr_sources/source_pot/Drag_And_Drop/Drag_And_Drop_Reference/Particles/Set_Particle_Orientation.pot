"This action is used to set the particle orientation - the angle at which the "
"particle images will be drawn - which can be static or set to increase / "
"decrease over time. You supply the unique ID value for the type to set the "
"size of (as returned when you created the type with the action <a href="
"\"Create_Particle_Type.htm\">Create Particle Type</a>) and then give a range "
"of initial starting orientations, then the increase amount and finally the "
"\"wiggle\". The orientation a particle is created at is calculated such that "
"0 is right, 90 is up, 180 is left and 270 is down, so a minimum setting of 0 "
"and a maximum setting of 360 will emit particles where each one will be "
"rotated by a random amount around 360° (note that this does <b>not</b> "
"affect particle direction)."

"The option to increase a particle orientation enables you to input a value "
"which will be added on to the base orientation angle each game frame of the "
"particle lifetime. So setting this value to, for example, 0.1 will add 0.1 "
"to the image angle each game frame. Note that you can use negative values "
"here too to make the particle rotate in the opposite direction too, so "
"positive values will make the particle rotate anti-clockwise, and negative "
"rotate clockwise. Note that the minimum orientation <i>decrement</i> that is "
"accepted is -0.01 and the minimum <i>increment</i> is 0.01."

"You can also set the \"wiggle\" option for the particle orientation. This is "
"a value that will be generated randomly between 0 and the value you give and "
"then added or subtracted to the particle image angle each step of the "
"particles lifetime, causing the drawn image to fluctuate in its rotation. "
"Obviously larger values are more pronounced than smaller ones, and this "
"value can even be a negative with the maximum range being between -20 and 20."

"Finally, you can choose to have the orientation as <i>relative</i> or not to "
"the particle direction. This means that while the particle has a direction ("
"and speed) set, the particle image will be orientated based on that vector. "
"Bear in mind that if you have the particle speed set to reduce and it "
"reaches 0 during the particle lifetime, the lack of speed sets the direction "
"to the default value of 0° and so a relative orientation will cause the "
"particle image to \"jump\" to a different orientation angle."
