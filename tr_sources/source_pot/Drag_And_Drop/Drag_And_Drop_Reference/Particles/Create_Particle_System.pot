"This action will initialise the particle system ready for you to create and "
"use particle types and emitters with it. You give the layer name as a string "
"- for example \"Particle Layer\" (which must exist in the room editor) - and "
"then flag the system as being <b>Persistent</b> or not. If the system is "
"flagged as Persistent then it will be persisted across all rooms after it "
"has been created, and it will be assigned a managed layer if the initial "
"layer does not exist in subsequent rooms. If persistence is <i>not</i> "
"flagged, then the system will be automatically destroyed at the end of the "
"room it was created in as will any emitters associated with the system. If "
"you wish to manually remove the system from memory, you need to use the "

"You also need to supply a target variable that will hold the unique particle "
"system ID value. This ID value is what will be used in other functions to "
"set properties of the system or to tell GameMaker Studio 2 what system to "
"use when creating particles. You can choose to flag this variable as being a "
"temporary local variable, but that will mean that it is discarded at the end "
"of the action script or event, meaning that the system will still exist but "
"leave you without any means to access it, so care must be taken when using "
"this (in general systems will never need to be stored in a temporary local "
"variable, but for certain things, like drawing particles to a surface, it "

"<b>NOTE</b>: A persistent particle system, once created, remains resident in "
"the system memory for the duration of the game, and so if you need to "
"recreate it at any point (for example, if you call the <a href=\"../Game/"
"Restart_Game.htm\">Restart Game</a> action), then you <b>must destroy the "
"current system first</b> otherwise you get a memory leak. A memory leak "
"happens when a resource is added to memory and then \"de-referenced\", "
"meaning that GameMaker Studio 2 has no way to interact with that resource "
"any more. This leads to the memory being clogged by inaccessible resources "
"which in turn can cause issues with your game. To destroy a persistent "
"particle system when no longer required use the action <a href="
"\"Destroy_Particle_System.htm\">Destroy Particle System</a>."
