"This action permits you to use a second particle type along with the primary "
"particle. You give the primary particle type ID value (which should be the "
"same as the value used when you created the particle using the <a href="
"\"Create_Particle_Type.htm\">Create Particle Type</a> action) and then you "
"can choose to have it emit a secondary particle type each game frame that it "
"exists and/or at the end of each primary particle's lifespan. You must give "
"another particle ID value for the \"Secondary\" and then a number to be "
"created in the \"Count\"."

"If the Event selected is \"Per Step\" then each game frame that a primary "
"particle exists on screen it will emit the given number of secondary "
"particles - for example, you could have a rocket with \"flame\" particles, "
"and each flame particle emits a secondary \"smoke\" particle. If the event "
"is set to \"On Death\", then the secondary particles will now only be "
"emitted when a particle of the primary type reaches the end of its lifespan -"
" for example, you could have an \"explosion\" particle that emits a \"dust\" "

"It is important to note that you <i>cannot</i> use the same particle type ID "
"as the primary particle as for secondary particles, and that you can very "
"quickly encounter performance issues when using this action as it's easy to "
"create thousands of particles very quickly this way - so take care to limit "
"the lifespan and number of particles being created by both the primary and "
"secondary particle types. Also note that you can assign a secondary particle "
"to any particle type and so can create \"particle chains\" where one "
"particle creates another each step and then this particle creates another "
"when it reaches the end of its lifespan, etc... Although, again, care should "
"be taken when chaining particles in this way to make sure that performance "
"does not suffer. You can also call this action twice for a single particle "
"type and have it stream on step as well as burst on death."
