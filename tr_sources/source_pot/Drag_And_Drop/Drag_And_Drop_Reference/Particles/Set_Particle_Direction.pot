"This action is used to set the particle direction, which can be static or "
"set to increase / decrease over time. You supply the unique ID value for the "
"type to set the size of (as returned when you created the type with the "
"action <a href=\"Create_Particle_Type.htm\">Create Particle Type</a>) and "
"then give a range of initial starting directions, then the increase amount "
"and finally the \"wiggle\". The direction a particle is created at is "
"calculated such that 0 is right, 90 is up, 180 is left and 270 is down, so a "
"minimum setting of -45 and a maximum setting of 45 will emit particles only "
"moving to the right, for example."

"The option to increase a particle direction enables you to input a value "
"which will be added on to the base direction value each game frame of the "
"particle lifetime. So setting this value to, for example, 0.1 will add 0.1 "
"to the direction each game frame. Note that you can use negative values here "
"too to make the particle move in the opposite direction down too, so "
"positive values will make the particle spiral anti-clockwise, and negative "
"clockwise. Note that the minimum direction <i>decrement</i> that is accepted "
"is -0.01 and the minimum <i>increment</i> is 0.01."

"Finally you can set the \"wiggle\" option. This is a value that will be "
"generated randomly between 0 and the value you give and then added or "
"subtracted to the direction each step of the particles lifetime, causing the "
"drawn image to fluctuate in direction. Obviously larger values are more "
"pronounced than smaller ones, and this value can even be a negative with the "
"maximum range being between -20 and 20."
