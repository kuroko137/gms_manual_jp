"To be able to see your particles you need to have first created a <a href="
"\"Create_Particle_System.htm\">Particle System</a>, then have defined some "
"<a href=\"Create_Particle_Type.htm\">particle types</a> and then finally "
"created a <b>particle emitter</b> using this action. To create the emitter, "
"you call this action and assign the emitter to a particle system that you "
"have previously created (see <a href=\"Create_Particle_System.htm\">Particle "
"System</a>) and then give a target variable to store it's unique ID value "
"for use in further actions. You can choose to flag this variable as being a "
"temporary local variable, but that will mean that it is discarded at the end "
"of the action script or event, meaning that the emitter will still exist but "
"leave you without any means to access it, so care must be taken when using "
"this (in general emitters will never need to be stored in a temporary local "
"variable, but for certain things, like drawing particles to a surface, it "
"may be required)."

"<b>IMPORTANT!</b> If your particle system is <b>persistent</b> then you must "
"either destroy all emitters at the end of each room using <a href="
"\"Destroy_Particle_Emitter.htm\">Destroy Particle Emitter</a> and re-create "
"them again in the next room as required, or store their ID values in "
"<b>global</b> variables so that they can be accessed anytime in any room, or "
"have them created by a persistent object, so that the object will persist "
"and be able to access them through instance variables. Also note that if you "
"call the <a href=\"../Game/Restart_Game.htm\">Restart Game</a> action you "
"should destroy the particle system beforehand so that the system and the "
"emitters assigned are removed from memory before starting again. Failure to "
"properly remove emitters from system memory as outlined above will lead to a "
"<b>memory leak</b>. This happens when a resource is added to memory and then "
"\"de-referenced\", meaning that GameMaker Studio 2 has no way to interact "
"with that resource any more. This leads to the memory being clogged by "
"inaccessible resources which in turn can cause issues with your game."
