"This action is used to set the particle speed, which can be static or set to "
"increase / decrease over time. You supply the unique ID value for the type "
"to set the size of (as returned when you created the type with the action <a "
"href=\"Create_Particle_Type.htm\">Create Particle Type</a>) and then give a "
"range of initial starting speeds, then the increase amount and finally the "
"\"wiggle\". The speed a particle is created at is calculated as pixels-per-"
"game-frame, so a minimum setting of 2 and a maximum setting of 5 will emit "
"particles moving at anywhere between 2 and 5 pixels-per-game-frame."

"The option to increase a particle speed enables you to input a value which "
"will be added on to the base speed value each game frame of the particle "
"lifetime. So setting this value to, for example, 0.1 will add 0.1 to the "
"speed each game frame. Note that you can use negative values here too to "
"make the particle slow down too, although the speed will never go below 0. "
"Note that the minimum speed <i>decrement</i> that is accepted is -0.01 and "

"Finally you can set the \"wiggle\" option. This is a value that will be "
"generated randomly between 0 and the value you give and then added or "
"subtracted to the speed each step of the particles lifetime, causing the "

"pronounced than smaller ones, and this value can even be a negative with the "
