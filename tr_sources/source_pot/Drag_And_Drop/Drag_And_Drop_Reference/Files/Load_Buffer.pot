"With this action you can load a buffer that was previously saved with the "
"action <a href=\"Save_Buffer.htm\">Save Buffer</a>. The action will create a "
"new buffer, load the data file into it, and return the unique ID value to "
"identify the buffer to the variable. You supply the name of the file to load "
"(as a string) and a variable to store the returned buffer ID in. Note that "
"if you flag the variable as a temporary local variable, you need to make "
"sure to delete the buffer this function creates before the end of the action "
"script or event, otherwise you will lose the reference to it and get a "
