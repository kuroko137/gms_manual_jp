"<b>Ini files</b> are small, lightweight files which are compatible with most "
"platforms. They are ideal for storing small pieces of information, like "
"interface preferences, local high scores, level data etc... and are very "
"easy to use. Ini files don't have to have been created previously to use "
"these actions, and you can read from a non-existent Ini file and you'll "
"simply get a <tt>default</tt> return value (which you specify), however we "
"recommend that you create at least a \"base\" ini file for opening and "
"modifying before using the actions. This base ini file can be created by "
"simply calling the <a a=\"\" href=\"Open_Ini_File.htm\">Open Ini File</a> "
"action followed by the <a href=\"Close_Ini_File.htm\">Close Ini File</a>, "
"since closing the file will write it to the disk, or you can include one in "
"the <a href=\"../../../Settings/Included_Files.htm\">Included Files</a> of "
"the Asset Browser. If you are using a file included in the Asset Browser as "
"your base Ini, you should also read the section of the manual about <a href="
"\"../../../Additional_Information/The_File_System.htm\">how the File System "
"works</a>."

"<b>NOTE</b>: For games with localizations it is very important that accented "
"letters can be read from external files. This means that you should create "

"Studio 2 as an included file so that it is exported on running the game and "
"used instead of the default ANSI format ini file that is created by the ini "
"functions when none has been previously supplied. In this way, you can read "
