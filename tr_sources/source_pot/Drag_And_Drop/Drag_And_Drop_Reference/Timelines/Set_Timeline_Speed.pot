"This action can be used to set the speed at which a timeline will move "
"through the moments it contains. Normally, in each game frame you'd want the "
"position in the timeline to be increased by 1, however you can change this "
"amount by setting this action to a different value. The value you choose "
"will be treated as a <i>multiplier</i> so a value of 2, for example, will "
"make the timeline run at twice the speed, while a value of 0.5 would make it "
"run at half the speed. What this means for the moments is that if the value "
"is greater than one, then several moments could occur within the same game "
"frame (no moments are ever skipped), and if the speed is less than one, then "
"after a moment has run, there will be frames where nothing happens until the "
"next moment runs - if you set the timeline speed to 0.1, for example, you "
"will get a moment on one game frame, then 9 game frames with no moments, and "
"on the tenth game frame the next moment will be run."
