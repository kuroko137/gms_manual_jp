"The <b>While</b> action is used to perform loops that only terminate when a "
"specific condition returns <tt>true</tt>. For example, you can use a "
"variable and set it to <tt>false</tt> then run the While loop and have it "
"checking this variable, then at some time in the loop you set the variable "
"to <tt>true</tt> and the loop will terminate. Note that no matter where you "
"set the condition within the while loop, <i>all</i> actions within the loop "
"will be run to the end before the rest of the script or event continues, "
"changing the condition does not instantly break out of the loop."

"When you add a While action into your code, you need to supply the variable "
"to check, what kind of check to perform (less than, greater than, equals, "
"etc...), and the value to check the variable against (you can also flag "
"<i>not</i> to have the While loop check to see if the condition is <i>not</"
"i> true). You then add the actions to be performed within the While loop, "
"much as you would add an action to an \"if\", ie: dropping it to the side of "
"the action rather than under it:"
