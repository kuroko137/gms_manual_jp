"The <b>For</b> action is used to perform loops that only terminate when a "
"value reaches the given condition. You give an initial value as a variable ("
"which can be flagged as a temporary local variable - this is usually what "
"you want), then you give the condition to check the variable against (for "
"example if it is less than a certain value), and then finally the amount to "
"increment the variable by each iteration of the loop. So, the general flow "
