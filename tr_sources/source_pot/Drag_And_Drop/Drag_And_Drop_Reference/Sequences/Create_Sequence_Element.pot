"With this action you can create a sequence element of any sequence from the "
"Asset Browser. You give the name of the sequence and an x/y position within "
"the room where it is to be created as well as the layer that it is to be "
"created on (this layer must be an <b>asset layer</b>). You can tick the "
"\"relative\" flags to position the sequence relative to the instance running "
"the action code blocks. Whenever you create a sequence in the game in this "
"way, it is given a unique <b>element ID</b> value with which you can then "
"identify the sequence in further actions, therefore this action permits you "
"to define a \"target\" variable to hold this ID value (as shown in the "
"example below). Note that the target can be flagged as a temporary (local) "
"variable, which will be created for the action and can be used in all "
"subsequent actions for the event the action is in."
