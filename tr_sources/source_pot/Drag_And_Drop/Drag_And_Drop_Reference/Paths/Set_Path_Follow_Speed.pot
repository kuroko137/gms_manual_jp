"This action will set the speed, in pixels per game frame, that an instance "
"should follow a path (note that you must have called the <a href="
"\"Start_Following_Path.htm\">Start Following Path</a> action to assign a "
"path to the instance for this to have any effect). You can use negative "
"values to signify that the instance should follow the path in reverse and "
"it's worth noting that the speed you set here can be modified by the speed "
"modifier set in the path editor for each path point, so if you set a path "
"speed to 2 and in the path one of the points has a speed modifier of 200% "
"the actual pixels per game frame speed at that point will be 4."
