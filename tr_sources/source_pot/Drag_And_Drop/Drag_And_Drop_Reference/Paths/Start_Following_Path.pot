"This action will start an instance following along a path that has been "
"created in the Asset Browser. You would then use this action to tell your "
"instance which path to follow, what speed to follow the path (measured in "
"pixels per game frame), how to behave when it reaches the end of the path, "
"and whether to follow the absolute or relative path position. When setting "
"the speed you can use negative values to signify that the instance should "
"follow the path in reverse and it's worth noting that the speed you set here "
"can be modified by the speed modifier set in the path editor for each path "
"point, so if you set a path speed to 2 and in the path one of the points has "
"a speed modifier of 200% the actual pixels per game frame speed at that "
