"With this action you can change one instance into another instance. You need "
"to specify the object that the instance it change into another instance of, "
"and the action will change the instance, performing the Destroy Event and "
"the Clean Up Event of the initial instance and the Create Event of the new "
"instance. Note that if you do not specify a direction or a speed etc... then "
"the new instance will \"inherit\" these values. For example, if the initial "
"instance has an <tt>image_angle</tt> (rotation) of 180, travels at 2px per "
"game tick and has an <tt>image_speed</tt> (animation speed) of 0.5, then the "
"instance it changes into will maintain these values unless explicitly set in "
"the Create event of the new instance."

"It is worth noting that changing the instance means that you <i>can perform "
"no further actions with that instance until the next game tick</i>, in "
"particular trying to access variables etc... as that will cause an error. "
"Basically, you change the instance but it is not actually available until "
"the end of the current step, so to access any of the variables it contains "
"directly (for example, calling <tt>inst_changed.x</tt>) will not work."
