"With this action you can create an instance of any object from the Asset "
"Browser. You give the name of the object and an x/y position within the room "
"where it is to be created as well as the name of the layer to create the "
"instance on (it must be an <b>Instance Layer</b>). You can tick the "
"\"relative\" flags to position the instance relative to the instance running "
"the action code blocks. Whenever you create an instance in the game, it is "
"given a unique ID value with which you can then identify the instance in "
"further actions, therefore this action permits you to define a \"target\" "
"variable to hold this ID value (as shown in the example below). Note that "
"the target can be flagged as a temporary (local) variable, which will be "
"created for the action and can be used in all subsequent actions."
