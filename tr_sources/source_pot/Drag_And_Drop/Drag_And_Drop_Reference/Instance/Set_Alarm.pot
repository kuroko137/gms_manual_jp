"This action block sets a given alarm to countdown, and when the alarm "
"reaches zero the associated <a href=\"../../../The_Asset_Editors/"
"Object_Properties/Object_Events.htm\">Alarm Event</a> will be triggered. You "
"supply the alarm number from 0 to 11, and then the value to set the alarm "
"to. The value used is the number of \"game steps\" that you want to pass "
"before the alarm event is triggered, and you can set this to be relative to "
"the current alarm value (adding or subtracting to the current value). Note "
"that the value must be an integer value, and you can set it to -1 to stop "
"the alarm. Note that when an alarm counts down, the event is run when it "
"reaches 0, but the alarm then counts down to -1 to show that it has "
"finished. Setting an alarm to 0 will <i>not</i> run the event, since it will "
"then count down to -1 next step, so to run an alarm immediately it should be "
"set to 1. Note that you can set additional alarms in the same action by "
"clicking the plus icon <img alt=\"{IMG_TXT} Expand Arguments Icon\" src=\""
