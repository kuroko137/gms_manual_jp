"This action can be used to move (seek) to a position within a buffer. You "
"supply the unique buffer ID value as returned by the action <a href="
"\"Create_Buffer.htm\">Create Buffer</a> and then the offset value in bytes "
"to move to. The offset value will be applied from the <i>start</i> of the "
"buffer, so calling this function will move the read/write position to the "
"start of the the buffer then move the number of bytes given along and "
"position the new read/write position there. However, if you flag the offset "
"as relative, it will move the read/write position forward (or backwards if "
"the offset is a negative value) from the current position."
