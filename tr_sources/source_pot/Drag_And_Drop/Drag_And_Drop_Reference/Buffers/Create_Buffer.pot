"This action can be used to allocate a portion of memory as a buffer in your "
"game, with the function returning the unique <i>buffer id</i> value that "
"should be stored in a variable and used for all further function calls to "
"the buffer. You can supply a global variable, an instance variable or have "
"the action create a temporary local variable for storing the buffer ID. Note "
"that you can create additional buffers by clicking the plus icon <span><img "

"<b>NOTE</b>: It's important that you remove any dynamically created "
"resources like this from memory when you no longer need them to prevent "
"memory leaks, so when you are finished with the buffer that you have created "
"you should free it up again using <a href=\"Delete_Buffer.htm\">Delete "
"Buffer</a> action (in the <a href=\"../../../The_Asset_Editors/"
"Object_Properties/Object_Events.htm\">Other - Clean Up</a> event, for "
"example). This is especially important to remember when using a temporary "
"local variable, as if you do not remove the buffer again before the end of "
"the event or action script then you will no longer be able access it and can "
"have issues later."
