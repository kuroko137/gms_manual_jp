"This action can be used to write data to a buffer. You supply the unique "
"buffer ID to write to (as returned by the action <a href=\"Create_Buffer."
"htm\">Create Buffer</a>) and then the value to write, which can be either a "
"real or a string, but note that <b>all values are stored as strings</b> so "
"when you read from the buffer (using <a href=\"Read_Buffer.htm\">Read "
"Buffer</a>) you may need to use one of the <a href=\"../Data_Types/"
"Data_Type_Actions.htm\">Data Type Actions</a> to convert it from a string "
"back to the original value. Keep in mind too that buffers are read and "
"written to <i>sequentially</i> and so writing to a buffer will move the "
"\"seek\" position along one, meaning that to write various pieces of data "
"you simply call this action the number of times required."
