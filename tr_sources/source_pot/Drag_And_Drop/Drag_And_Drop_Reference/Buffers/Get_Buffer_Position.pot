"This action can be used to retrieve the current position for reading/writing "
"to the buffer. When you create a buffer, the read/write position is set at 0 "
"bytes, and as you add data to the buffer this position will move along "
"sequentially, meaning that you can use this action to get the number of "
"bytes into the buffer that it is set to at any time. You supply the unique "
"buffer ID value as returned by the action <a href=\"Create_Buffer.htm\""
">Create Buffer</a> and then give a target variable to return the position "
"value to. The target variable can be flagged as being a temporary local "
"variable, in which case it will be created for you and removed from memory "
"again at the end of the current action script or event."
