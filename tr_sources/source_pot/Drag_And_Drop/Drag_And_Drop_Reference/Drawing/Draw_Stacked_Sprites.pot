"This action will draw a sprite a given number of sprites one after another "
"at a given position within the room. You give the sprite to draw and the "
"stack order, which can be either <b>Row</b> (horizontally, left to right), "
"or <b>column</b> (vertically, top to bottom), as well as the number of "
"sprites to draw and the position. The position can be an absolute position "
"within the room, or one relative to the position of the instance doing the "
"drawing, and the spacing between images will be based on the width or height "
"of the sprite. Note that this simply draws a static image - the initial "
"single image (frame 0) of the given sprite - and any further frames will be "
"ignored, as will any transforms that have been added through changing the <a "
