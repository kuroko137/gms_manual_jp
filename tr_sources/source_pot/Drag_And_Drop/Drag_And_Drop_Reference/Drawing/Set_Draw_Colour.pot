"With this action you can set the colour to use for any shapes (rectangle/"
"ellipse/line) or for any text that is drawn subsequently. Note that this "
"does not have to be called before every draw action, and can be set once "
"only at the start of the game. For example, if all your text is going to be "
"yellow, you can call this action in the Create Event of the first room of "
"the game, and all text (and shapes) will then be drawn yellow from then "
"onwards. However if you need to use multiple different colours, then you "
"will need to call this before each text or shape that requires a different "
"colour."
