"When you add any type of action or code to the Draw Event of an object, you "
"are telling GameMaker Studio 2 that you are taking over and that <i>you</i> "
"will tell it what to draw from now on (by default an instance will draw the "
"sprite assigned to it in the object editor when there are no actions in the "
"main Draw Event). This means that any assigned sprite will no longer be "
"drawn unless you explicitly say so, which is when you would use this action. "
"This simply draws the assigned sprite for the object with any transforms "
"that may have been set in previous events (like scaling, blending or changes "
"in alpha) at the current sub-image."
