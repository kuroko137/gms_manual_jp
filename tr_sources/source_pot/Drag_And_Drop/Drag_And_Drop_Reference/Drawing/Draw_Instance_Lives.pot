"This action will draw a sprite to represent each of the lives the instance "
"currently have. The number to draw is taken from the current value of the "
"local instance variable <tt>lives</tt>, which is a special variable that is "
"created automatically within the instance if you use any of the actions that "
"require it. You give the sprite to draw for the lives and the stack order, "
"which can be either <b>Row</b> (horizontally, left to right), or <b>column</"
"b> (vertically, top to bottom), as well as the position. The position can be "
"an absolute position within the room, or one relative to the position of the "
"instance doing the drawing, and the spacing between images will be based on "
"the width or height of the sprite. Note that this simply draws a static "
"image - the initial single image (frame 0) of the given sprite - and any "
"further frames will be ignored, as will any transforms that have been added "
"to the instance through changing the instance variables (like "
"<tt>image_xscale</tt> or <tt>image_blend</tt>). Caption text will be drawn "
"preceding the lives value and if it is text it should be wrapped with \"\", "
"and both will be formatted using the current draw font , colour and "
"alignment."
