"This action will draw a sprite somewhere in the room. You specify the "
"sprite, the position (either an absolute position within the room, or a "
"relative position to the instance doing the drawing) and the animation frame "
"of the sprite, if it has multiple frames (note that image frames are "
"numbered from 0 upwards). If you have an animated sprite and you want it to "
"draw the frames as if it was assigned to the object, then use -1 for the "
"frame index or the built in instance variable <tt>image_index</tt>, but note "
"that if the instance has no sprite assigned then it will not animate, and if "
"the sprite assigned has a different number of frames to the one being drawn "
"then the sprite will be drawn with extra frames or missed frames."
