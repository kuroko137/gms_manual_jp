"The pitch value is a pitch <i>multiplier</i>, in that the input value "
"multiplies the current pitch by that amount, so the default value of 1 is no "
"pitch change, while a value of less than 1 will lower the pitch and greater "
"than 1 will raise the pitch. It is best to use small increments for this "
"function as any value under 0 or over 5 may not be audible anyway. It is "
"worth noting that the total pitch change permitted is clamped to (1/256) - "
"256 octaves, so any value over or under this will not be registered."
