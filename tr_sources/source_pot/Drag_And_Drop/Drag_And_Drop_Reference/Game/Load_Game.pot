"This action will load a game that has previously been saved using the <a "
"href=\"Save_Game.htm\">Save Game</a> action. You give the filename of the "
"file to load (as a string, and including the extension) and the game will be "
"loaded and continue running from the saved point. Note that this is not "
"designed as a universal save/load system, and trying to load a game saved "
"from a previous run of the project may give errors (especially if you have "
"used things like <a href=\"../Data_Structures/Data_Structure_Actions.htm\""
">Data Structures</a> or <a href=\"../Particles/Particle_Actions.htm\""
">Particles</a>), and as such you should only try and load games that have "
"been saved in the progress of a single game play-through (for things like "
"checkpoints). Also note that the file will <i>not</i> be loaded until the "
"end of the current event or script, so any actions after the load action is "
"called will still be performed. For a more comprehensive approach to loading "
"saved game data, see the <a href=\"../Files/File_Actions.htm\">File "
"Actions</a>."
