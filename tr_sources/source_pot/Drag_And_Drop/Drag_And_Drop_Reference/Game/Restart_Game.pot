"With this action you can restart the game. This is similar to running the "

"should be noted that global variables will not be re-initialised unless "
"explicitly coded as such - meaning that if you don't define and set them in "

"Restart Game action is called <i>or</i> in the Game End Event. Also note "
"that the game will <i>not</i> restart the moment this action is called, but "
"rather at the end of the script or event where the action is placed, so if "
"there are any actions placed after this one, they will still be called and "
"the game restarted at the end of the block."
