"This action will do a basic save of the game to a given file. You give a "
"filename (as a string and including the extension) and the action will "
"perform a limited save out of the current game state. It's important to "
"understand that the action is designed to take a \"snapshot\" of the current "
"game state and is for use more as a checkpoint system than a universal save "
"system, since it does <i>not</i> save any of the dynamic resources (like <a "
"href=\"../Data_Structures/Data_Structure_Actions.htm\">Data Structures</a> "
"or <a href=\"../Particles/Particle_Actions.htm\">Particles</a>). As such the "
"action should be used very carefully so as not to get errors or memory "
"leaks. For a more comprehensive approach to saving your game data, see the "
