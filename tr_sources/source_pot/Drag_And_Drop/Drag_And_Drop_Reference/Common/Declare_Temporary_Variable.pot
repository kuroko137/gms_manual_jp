"This action is used to declare and give an initial value to a <b>temporary "
"variable </b>(also called a <b>local variable</b>), which is a variable that "
"<i>only exists for the duration of the event or script that it was declared "
"in</i>. Temporary variables are very useful for storing values that are only "
"needed for a single operation and prevent your objects becoming \"cluttered\""
" with variables that may only be used once. They are also very useful for "
"breaking down complex operations, or for setting values in other instances "
"when you change the action scope. This is because variables declared as "
"temporary are<i>not</i>scoped to any particular instance, but instead scoped "
"to the event or script itself, so if you create a temporary variable and "
"then change the action scope using the <a href=\"Apply_To...htm\">Apply "
"To...</a> action, you can still check the temporary variable without issues "
"and without changing its action scope."
