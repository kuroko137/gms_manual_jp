"The \"else\" action is <i>only ever used in conjunction with <a href="
"\"If_Variable.htm\">If Variable</a></i> (or any other \"if\" action), and is "
"a way of defining a set of actions that should be performed if the \"if\" "
"evaluation returns <tt>false</tt>. For example, you could have an \"if\" "
"action that checks if the players health variable is less than or equal to "
"0, and if that evaluates to true you destroy the instance. However if you "
"want to perform a different set of code actions if the player health is "
"<i>not</i> less than 0 then you can add an \"else\" in and then specify the "
"actions to be performed while the if evaluates to <tt>false</tt>."
