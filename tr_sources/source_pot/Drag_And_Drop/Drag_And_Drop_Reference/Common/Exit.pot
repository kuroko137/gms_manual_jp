"This action is will do one of two things depending on the context within "
"which it is called. If it is called from within an event, then it will exit "
"the event and move on to the next one, skipping any action block code that "
"may be placed after it. However if it is used within an <a href=\"../../"

"a>, then it will exit the function only and return to the event that called "
"the function, running any subsequent actions. Note that calling this in the "
"middle of a function will <i>not</i> return any value (for that use the <a "
"href=\"Return.htm\">return</a> action)."
