"This action can be used to create a new user-defined function, which can "

"one that you define to do a task that isn't covered by the available DnD™ "
"actions or GML runner functions, and can be global, instance or local in "
"scope (see <a href=\"../../../GameMaker_Language/GML_Overview/"
"Variables_And_Variable_Scope.htm\">here</a> for more information on scope) "
"and they can also be used as <b>constructors</b> to create <a href=\""

"out more about using this action to create global functions, please see the "
"section on <a href=\"../../Drag_And_Drop_Overview/Action_Block_Functions."
"htm\">Creating Action Functions</a>. You may also flag the function as being "
"<b>static</b>, which means that it will only be defined once the first time "
