"As you can see, the results will depend on the collision mask of the "
"instance being checked for, meaning the instance of the object you are "
"looking for <i>must</i> have a sprite assigned to the <tt>sprite_index</tt>, "
"or a sprite assigned to the <tt>mask_index</tt>. If it does not then it will "
"not be detected by these functions, regardless of whether it is drawing a "
"sprite or not. It is worth noting that any instance that falls completely "
"within the boundaries set for the ellipse or rectangle shape will also "
"return a collision. The action will evaluate to <tt>true</tt> if a collision "
"is detected, or <tt>false</tt> otherwise, although you can also check the "
"<b>Not</b> flag to check if there is <i>not</i> a collision with the given "
"shaped area, and the action will then only evaluate as <tt>true</tt> if "
"<i>no</i> collisions are found, otherwise it will evaluate as <tt>false</"
"tt>. You can also set the <b>Exclude Self</b> option to exclude the calling "
"instance from the collision check."
