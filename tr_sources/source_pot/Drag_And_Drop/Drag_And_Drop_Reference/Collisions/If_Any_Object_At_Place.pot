"This action is used to check and see if there is an instance of <i>any</i> "
"object placed at a position based on the collision mask of the calling "
"instance. You give the position, which can be an absolute position or a "
"position relative to the instance, and the action will return <tt>true</tt> "
"if there is a collision or <tt>false</tt> if there is not. You can also "
"check the \"Not\" flag to check if there is <i>not</i> a collision at the "
"given position, and the action will then return <tt>true</tt> if no "
"collisions are found and <tt>false</tt> otherwise. Collisions are calculated "
