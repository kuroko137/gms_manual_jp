"When you compile your game, you usually use the \"Local\" worker, which is "
"the computer that GameMaker Studio 2 has been installed on. However under "
"some circumstances you may need to use another computer to build your "
"projects. For example, if you are working on a Mac and you want to build a "
"Windows project, then you would want to configure a <strong>Remote Worker</"
"strong> and have a Windows PC do the build. Essentially, when you use a "
"remote worker, GameMaker Studio 2 will send all the required files from the "
"(local) machine it is running on to the remote worker machine, and then use "
"that machine to build the final executable for the project (either saving it "
"on the remote machine, or returning it to the local machine afterwards). "
"However, before you can use this functionality you will have to have "
"installed certain tools on the build machine and performed some setting up, "
"which we will explain here."
