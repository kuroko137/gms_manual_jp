"At some point when creating a game of any complexity you will probably have "
"to deal with <strong>vectors</strong>. They are used in physics, in AI, in "
"trigonometry and many other situations, but what is a vector? Well, to put "
"it simply, a vector is a <em>directed quantity</em>. Let's start by looking "
"at a 1 dimensional vector - which is just the same as a single number - by "
"drawing a numbered line with an arrow starting at zero and ending at 5. This "
"is the vector \"a\" which is equal to 5 and if we draw another arrow "
"starting at the 5 and ending at the 8 we have vector \"b\" which is equal to "

"You should realise that it doesn't matter where a vector starts, all that "
"matters is how long it is and what direction it goes in. So vector \"b\" "
"starts at 5, is 3 units long and points to the \"right\", making it "
"identical to a vector starting at 0 and going to 3. Now, you can also add "
"these vectors together, by putting the two vectors \"a\" and \"b\" end to "
"end to get the vector \"c\" which is equal to 8. What about negative "
"numbers? Well, if, in the above image, a vector that points to the \"right\" "
"corresponds to a positive number, you can see that a vector pointing to the "
"\"left\" would correspond to a negative number, making a one-dimensional "
"vector nothing more than a signed (+/-) number. This explains the essential "
"concept of a vector: only <em>length</em> and <em>direction</em> (\"left\" "
"or \"right\" in this case) count, not position."
