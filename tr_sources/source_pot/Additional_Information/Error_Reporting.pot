"Most runner error messages follow the same outline, with a message stating "
"the type of error, the instance and event in which the error was "
"encountered, then a series of runner details that explain the error in a lot "
"more depth and, finally, a list of all the declared global, instance and "
"local variables in your game at that point. At the very bottom is the "
"<strong>Abort </strong>button which will abort the game, as well as the "
"<strong>Copy </strong>button (which copies the error into the clipboard) and "
"the <strong>Clear </strong>button which clears the error messages from the "
"window. The information provided by the error reporting here is very "
"important as it detects and reports the large, syntax related bugs that are "
"going to cause your finished game to crash, but note that it won't report "
"more subtle bugs, nor does it give feedback on performance... for that you "
"need to use the the <a href=\"../IDE_Tools/The_Debugger.htm\">Debugger</a>."
