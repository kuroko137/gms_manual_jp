"A buffer (in programming) is basically a space within the system memory that "
"is used to store small packets of data for just about anything (for example: "
"data transfer, collisions, colour data etc...). Since it is held in system "
"memory it is very fast to access, and a buffer would generally be used for "
"very short-term storage, like receiving network information before "

"So, if your byte-alignment is set to, say, 4 bytes and you write a single "
"piece of data which is 1 byte in size then do a buffer <strong>tell "
"</strong>(a tell gets the current position for reading/writing for the "
"buffer), you'll get an <strong>offset </strong>of 1 byte (the offset in this "
"case is the number of bytes from the start of the buffer to the current read/"
"write position)."

"However, if you write another piece of data, also 1 byte in size, <em>then </"
"em>do a buffer tell, you'll get an offset of 5 bytes (even though you have "
"only written 2 bytes of data) as the alignment has padded the data to align "

"Basically, what this means is that alignment will only affect <em>where </"
"em>things are written to, so if you do a buffer tell after you write "
"something, it'll return the current write position which immediately follows "
"the data you've previously written. Note, however, that if you then write "
"another piece of data, internally the buffer will move the write position "
"along to the next multiple of the alignment size before actually writing the "
