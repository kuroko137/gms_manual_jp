"In most games you will want certain things to happen at precise moments in "
"time. Now, you can try to achieve this by using the alarm events but when "
"things get too complicated this won't work any more, especially as you are "
"limited to only twelve alarms. That's why we have the <strong>timeline </"
"strong>asset. In a timeline you specify which actions must happen at certain "
"moments in game time, and you can use all the actions that are also "
"available for an object in its different events or code to define this. Once "
"you create a time line you can then assign it to an object, and the instance "
"of that object will then execute the actions at the indicated moments of "
"time when placed or created within a room."

"For example, assume you want to make a guard and that this guard should move "
"20 time steps to the left, then 10 upwards, then 20 to the right, then 10 "
"downwards and then finally stop. To achieve this you can make a timeline "
"where you start with setting a motion to the left. You would then create "
"moment 20 (a \"moment\" is just another way of saying \"game step\" or \"game"
" frame\") and set a motion upward, then at moment 30 a motion to the right, "
"at moment 50 a motion downwards and finally at moment 60 you would stop the "
"motion. Once that is done, you can assign this timeline to the guard object "
"and the guard instance will do exactly what you planned when placed in a "
"room. You could even set an alarm in the time line so that it is repeated "
"after a certain length of time and in this way your guard can patrol an "
"area. You can also use a time line to control your game more globally, for "
"example by creating an invisible controller object, then a time line that at "
"certain moments creates enemies, and then assigning it to the controller "
"object and placing an instance into the room. This is an easy way to get "
"timed spawns of the enemies in a space shoorter game or something like that."
