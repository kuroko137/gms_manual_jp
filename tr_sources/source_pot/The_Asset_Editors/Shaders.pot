"Shaders are a very powerful tool that can be used to manipulate the graphics "

"A shader is basically a two-part program that runs directly on the graphics "
"card itself, making it very fast since the GPU is doing all the work and "
"freeing up CPU cycles for your game code. The full shader is comprised of a "
"vertex shader program, and a fragment shader program (also known as a pixel "
"shader). Both of these tiny programs work together in order to manipulate "
"what the graphics card renders to the screen. This then permits you to "
"manipulate in real time, the position, colour and alpha values that are "
"actually <a class=\"tooltip\" title=\"TITLE_KEY::rendered\">rendered</a> "

"The Vertex Shader is the programmable shader stage in the rendering pipeline "
"that handles the processing of individual vertices (the points of the "
"triangles used to render any image), and when you are rendering a geometry - "
"like a sprite or a surface - GameMaker Studio 2 creates a stream of vertices "
"- called a <strong>Vertex Buffer </strong>- that defines the geometry of "
"these triangles. A sprite for example would have a geometry of two triangles "
"(normally called <em>polygons</em>) rendered together to form a \"quad\". "
"This vertex stream from the Vertex Buffer is fed as an input to the Vertex "
"Shader, which can process the vertices data in a programmable way. The "
"Vertex Shader output is used by the GPU to assemble triangles, which are "
"then properly clipped and culled to the view port and view camera, and then "
"sent on to the rasterizer block of the GPU which generates a new output "
"stream, constituted by something called <strong>Fragments</strong>. These "
"are tiny data structures, each of which is relative to a single pixel that "
"appears on the screen."

"The Fragment Shader is the programmable shader stage in the rendering "

"texture any given polygon - and they are responsible for outputting the "

"this: the Fragment Shader receives as its input all those fragments (the "
"individual pixels of the triangle being rendered) that have been passed "
"along the pipeline by the Vertex Shader. It can then process these fragments "
"to change the colour and alpha of the final destination pixel that will be "
