"An asset layer is simply a graphical asset (sprite or sequence) that has "
"been placed into the room independently of instances, and you can place them "
"by either dragging them in from the <a href=\"../../Introduction/"
"The_Asset_Browser.htm\">Asset Browser</a> or by selecting the one you want "
"in the Asset Browser and then using <img alt=\"{IMG_TXT} Alt Icon\" class="
"\"icon\" src=\"../../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_Alt.png\" style=\"width: 100%; "
"max-width: 55px;\" /> + <img alt=\"{IMG_TXT} LMB Icon\" class=\"icon\" src=\""
"../../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_LMB.png\" style=\"width: 100%; max-width: "
"21px;\" /> to \"paint\" them. Sprite assets are similar to tiles, only they "
"can be fully animated - if the sprite used has sub-images they will be shown "
"- without the restrictions that are in place for tiles, ie: they aren't "
"forced to a grid and animations can be any length and speed. Sequences are "
"\"cellections\" of sprites, sounds and instances that will play when the "
"room is entered."

"It is worth noting that each asset on the layer is automatically flagged for "

"specific sprites to be added to the room in the final game. If that is the "
"case, then simply un-checking the \"<strong>Export</strong>\" checkbox to "
"the left of the sprite in the layer properties list will prevent it from "
"being exported as part of the executable. It is important to note, however, "
"that if you have any code that references that asset, then the game will not "
"run correctly, so use this feature with care."
