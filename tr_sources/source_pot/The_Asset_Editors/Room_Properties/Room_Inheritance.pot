"An important feature of the room editor is <strong>inheritance</strong>. "
"Inheritance means that you can create a \"parent\" room then from that "
"create a \"child\" room which will inherit all the parent room's properties. "
"This child room is essentially a <em>clone </em>of the parent, and "
"everything in it <strong>is linked to the parent room</strong>. This means "
"that if you change the view in the parent, or move a tile, or add instances, "
"it will be reflected in the child room. Not only that, in the child room you "
"can selectively switch off inheritance for specific layers, instances, "
"assets or anything else that is required."

"This can be a bit difficult to visualise at first, so let's look at an "

"city and castle are drawn using different tile layers and you also have "
"instances and some paths for NPCs to use to walk around. You want to have it "
"so that in the game the castle is destroyed, but everything else in the city "
"looks and behaves the same. You would create the initial room with "
"everything as normal, then you'd create a child room which inherits the "
"parent room layers. In the child room you'd switch <em>off </em>inheritance "
"for the tile layer (or even individual tiles) for the castle area and them "
"move/add/delete tiles to create the destroyed castle look. When a player "
"enters that room, all the instances from the parent room and all the tiles "
"etc... will remain exactly the same, except for those of the destroyed "

"Note that, within a room, inheritance is multi-layered and you can check "
"individual items, groups of items on a single layer, item properties, or "
"whole rooms as inheriting, and you can also inherit from consecutive rooms ("
"so room C inherits from room B, which in turn has inherited from Room A). If "
"you create a base room with nothing in it except the view setup - for "
"example - you can then create all further rooms as being its children and "

"a step further and create another base room with the \"view\" room as its "
"parent which holds the general <a class=\"tooltip\" title=\"TITLE_KEY::GUI\""
">GUI</a> instance and the controllers required in every game room. Now you "
