"This event is triggered when an instance goes outside the room, and is based "
"on a check done against the assigned sprite (and its properties) of the "
"instance, so that even if you have set the image x or y scale to a value "
"other than one, this event will only be triggered when the whole sprite "
"would be out the screen. If the instance has no sprite, then the position of "
"the instance is used and the moment its x or y position is outside of the "
"room then it will trigger the event too. This event is typically used for "
"things like bullets, where they are destroyed once they leave the room so "
"you don't end up with millions of bullets flying away infinitely and causing "
"your game to slow down. Note that this event is only triggered once when the "
"instance leaves the room initially."

"this event in really only viable for <strong>Windows</strong>, "
"<strong>Ubuntu </strong>(Linux) and <strong>macOS</strong> games as mobile "
"devices may just close the game without giving GameMaker Studio 2 the chance "
"to call this event. For browser games made with the HTML5 module, this event "

"support this feature (Firefox, Chrome and Safari do at the time of writing) "
"so care must be taken when using it. Typically you would use this event to "

"In GameMaker Studio 2 sprites are not static things as they can have sub-"
"images and be animated at different speeds. Each frame of an animation ("

"in code or through actions, but sometimes all you really need to know is "
"when the animation has ended. That's when this event is triggered, right at "
"the end of the animation when the sub image index shows that the last frame "

"an explosion object where you can set the instance to destroy itself when "
