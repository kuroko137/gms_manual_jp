"At some point while creating your games you may need one of your instances "
"to follow a path through a level. Now, this can be done in code by simply "
"creating an array of positions within the room and then having an instance "
"move between them, but that can be a chore to set up and is difficult to "
"change, test and adapt for different instances. For this reason GameMaker "
"Studio 2 has path resources and a dedicated path editor."

"The basic idea is rather simple - you define a path by drawing it in the "

"an object to tell the instance to follow that particular path. You can also "
"set the speed to follow the path and a number of other actions relating to "
"the position and orientation of the path within the room. When you first "
"create a path resource the path editor window will open with the following "

"As with all resources in GameMaker Studio 2 you should give your new path a "
"unique name as this is what will be used to identify it throughout the game "
"you are making, and a good system that a lot of people use is to prefix (or "

"Once you have named the path, you can start to define it by placing points "
"in the main editor on the right, with each point being added to the list "
"here along with its position and speed. The speed value for path points is "
"defined by a percentage of the speed at which you make the instance move "
"along the path (default is 100%). So if you start an instance at a speed of "
"2 (2 pixels per step) along a path and then one of the path points has a "
"speed value of 50%, the instance will reduce speed as it approaches this "
"points to a speed of 1 (50% of the path speed). Equally, you can set the "
"speed to 150% and the instance will accelerate as it reaches the point. In "
"this way you can create some nice dynamic looking movement without any code "
"whatsoever."
