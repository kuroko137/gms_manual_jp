"To create an extension for Android you have to do it in two parts. The first "
"part would be to add the extension itself, along with the required files "
"etc... and the second is to create the functions and macros/constants that "
"the extension requires. The functions and constants are added using "
"<strong>placeholder </strong>files to group them together, so you'd add a "
"placeholder and then define the functions and macros as explained in the "
"section above. To add the rest of the files though you need to first tick "
"the <em>Android </em>check-box in the <strong>Additional Features</strong> "
