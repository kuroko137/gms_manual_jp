"Tiles are generally considered to be static cells within the game room, "
"however with GameMaker Studio 2 it is possible to animate them, just as you "
"would a sprite. Why not just use sprites, you ask? Well, sprites have a "
"certain processing overhead due to them being associated with a bounding box "
"and the way in which they are rendered, but tiles have a much lower "
"processing overhead and so are faster to render. This does come at a price "
"however, in that with tile set animations you are limited to creating "
"animations that must be a power of two in length - ie: of 2, 4, 8, 16, "
"etc... frames - and they must obviously be created within the tile grid, "
"<em>and </em>they must all animate at the same speed (on a per-tile set "
"basis). However, even with these limitations, animated tiles are a powerful "
"feature that can be used to add life and colour to otherwise static "
"environments and backgrounds."

"The example image above is a single image with all animation frames "

"contain other non-animation tiles too, since you can use a single massive "
"tile set and then \"cherry pick\" the parts of it that you want to create "

"with trees, earth and water, and within the tile set have multiple tiles to "
