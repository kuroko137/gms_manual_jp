"GameMaker Studio 2 is a tool designed to empower you and your team to make "
"new and innovative games as well as prototype ideas in the fastest and most "
"intuitive way possible across multiple target platforms. It is intended "
"primarily as a tool for making 2D games - although 3D games are perfectly "

"your dreams and ideas, with your final project being ported across multiple "

"This help file will tell you all you need to know about GameMaker Studio 2 "
"and how you can create your own games with it. However, please realise that "
"even with a program like GameMaker Studio 2, designing computer games is not "
"completely effortless - so no \"make me a MMORPG\" button here! Be aware too "
"that there are many aspects to making games and that they are all equally "
"important: game-play, graphics, sounds, user interaction, etc... But, the "
"most important aspect of all, is patience. While GameMaker Studio 2 is a "
"powerful tool, it cannot do everything for you at the touch of a button so "
"start small with simple examples and you will find that not only is creating "
"games great fun, but that learning to use GameMaker Studio 2 to do it is "
"also very rewarding!"
