"Creating a tutorial is similar to <a href=\"Creating_A_Marketplace_Asset."
"htm\">creating a regular Marketplace asset package</a>, only now you have to "
"add in specific included files as well as include an initial tutorial page ("
"and an optional video page). The Tutorial workspace will look something like "

"Marketplace Assets, you need to select a publisher and then give your "
"tutorial a name and a unique ID (reverse URL format), and then in the \"type"
"\" dropdown select Tutorial. This will then give you additional options to "
"add a base HTML file to start the tutorial from as well as an (optional) "
"video file and URL. The video file should use the template supplied from the "
"Marketplace - as should the rest of the tutorial - which you can get <a href="

"be loaded into a separate frame within the IDE. Note that the pages you give "
