"The Marketplace has a great number of assets available to you, and it can "
"sometimes be difficult to decide whether a package is what you require or "
"not. To help you decide, there is a <strong>Rating and Comment</strong> "

"an asset package has and also read the comments made by other users."

"When rating a product from the Marketplace, take into consideration not only "
"whether it was useful to you personally, but whether you think it is of use "

"whether it had extra features or whether you think it was well made or not. "
"Marking something with one star simply because it was not what you expected "
"or don't understand how it works is unfair to the person that uploaded the "
