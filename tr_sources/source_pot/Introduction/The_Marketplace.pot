"game engines or frameworks. To be able to create, buy and sell packages, you "
"must first be registered on the Marketplace as a publisher and have signed "
"in through GameMaker Studio 2 (this will be automatic when you log into the "
"program) or from the main <a href=\"https"
"://marketplace{-dot-}yoyogames{-dot-}com/\">Marketplace web page</a>. You "
"can find more information on becoming a publisher from the pages linked at "
