"Next you can set the <strong>Windows Sleep Margin</strong>. This option is "
"related to reducing stuttering when running your game on specific systems. "
"Basically, if your game is running faster than your room speed GameMaker "
"Studio 2 will \"sleep\" for the remaining time, but this sleep can be quite "
"inaccurate and you can often end of sleeping for longer than necessary, "
"causing your frame to take longer which causes stuttering. To get around "
"this we can sleep for less time, then sit in a tight loop for the remainder "
"of the time to make it more accurate - although the problem with sitting in "
"a loop is that it causes CPU usage to increase, which in turn can cause your "
"CPU temperatures to rise and your fan to run faster. By default, this value "
"is set to 10, and in 99.99% of the cases you'll be fine with this, but for "
"low end machines or for machines with a lot of background processes running "
"this may not be an ideal solution (or for very high end machines too) and a "
"value of 1 or 15 or something may be required. Note though that this is very "
"much a system specific configuration and what works on your build machine "
"may not be appropriate for another user, and as such if in doubt leave it "
"set to 10."
