"Now, when your game is large with a lot of artistic resources, it may be "
"that the way GameMaker Studio 2 automatically creates these pages is not the "
"optimum for getting the most out of the target device, due to the fact that "
"if a room in your game needs resources from 4 different texture pages, the "
"device will have to swap these pages into (and out of) memory constantly, "
"which may cause a loss in performance. To that end, you have the option to "
"tell GameMaker Studio 2 what images are to be placed on any specific texture "
"page by assigning them to specific <strong>Texture Groups</strong>. The "
"final aim of this is to minimise the number of swaps being done in a game at "

"would be created for each target. This is very handy for working out how "

"Should you have a texture in your game that is larger than the maximum "
"selected texture page size, then this will be <em>scaled down by half </em>("
"and half again if necessary) until it fits on the maximum page size. It will "
"<em>not </em>be split into sections over various texture pages. This means "
"that when you test your game on Windows, Ubuntu (Linux) or MacOS the game "
"may look fine as you are using larger texture pages, but on iOS (or any of "
"the other targets that require a smaller texture page size for optimal "
"performance) the texture may look blurred or have artefacts. It is essential "
"that you make sure your images are all able to fit on the smallest of the "
"texture page sizes that your game will use, and if not then you should split "
"them into smaller images and then draw them together in your game to give "
"the illusion of one large, complete, image."

"<strong>NOTE</strong>: Before you go off splitting up your graphics over "

"Introduction/Debugging.htm\">Debugging</a> for more information) and those "
"games will not benefit greatly from this optimisation, and you should also "
"consider whether it would not be better to have all your images on two "
"texture pages and swap between them rather than spread out over several, "
