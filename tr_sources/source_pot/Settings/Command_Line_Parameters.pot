"When creating games it is important that you play test the executable file "
"to make sure that the final compile is correct and has no unforeseen errors "
"or differences. However creating an executable means that, since you have no "
"access to the debug console nor to the compiler window, it can be difficult "
"to pin down and debug any problems that you may find. However there is a fix "
"for this, and that is to use <strong>command line parameters</strong> to set "
"certain properties when the executable version of the game is run, in turn "
"permitting you to create output log files and test other special situations."
