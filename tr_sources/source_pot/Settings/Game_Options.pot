"<strong>Game Frames Per Second</strong>: This value sets the limit on the "
"number of frames per-second that GameMaker Studio 2 should try to maintain "
"your games when running. This value represents the number of times that the "
"game loop will run in one second (a single game loop is considered a single "
"\"frame\") and is set to a default value of 60, although 30 is often used "
"too. There are many arguments about which room speed is the ideal, but the "
"actual answer depends on what type of game you are making, the size of the "
"room, the number of instances and how intensive the code is. For example, if "
"you have a large room and a room speed of 30, the game may appear \"choppy\" "
"as the larger the area you are looking at, the easier it is for the eye to "
"perceive low room speeds, but if the game is intensive then setting the room "
"speed to 120 may cause the game to \"lag\" as the fps drops due to the "
"amount of processing being done. So take care with this value and try to "
"always adjust it to what your game needs."

"<strong>Generate mipmaps for separate texture pages</strong>: This option "
