When one occurs, you can use the ","Copy"," button on the pop-up to copy the error to the clipboard\n    which you can then paste into a text file (or wherever) for future reference.","\n  ","The structure of this error is as follows:","\n  ","\n    "," This shows the Event that the error has occurred in as well as the Object (where applicable).","\n    "," This shows the actual error.  So, it shows the ","scope ","of the error\n      and the type of error it is. The first value in the brackets will be the instance ID of the instance that was running the code - or it could be one of the special values listed in the table below - and the second is an internal value that YoYo Games\n      uses for identifying bugs and can be ignored.

Note that this is not always 100% accurate due to the way the game is compiled, but it should be enough to help you find exactly where the issue is.","\n  ","\n  ","As mentioned above, certain error messages will be identify the scope not by an instance ID value, but rather by a ","negative ","value.
