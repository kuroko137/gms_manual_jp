You give the position, which can be an absolute position or a position relative to the instance,\n    and the action will return ","true"," if there is a collision or ","false"," if there is not. You can also check the \"Not\" flag to check if there is ","not"," a collision at the given position, and the action will then return ","true","    if no collisions are found and ","false"," otherwise.
