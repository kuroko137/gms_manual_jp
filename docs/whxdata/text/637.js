In the example, it is worth\n    noting how we check which event is being called so that the rest of the function is only run on the specific event that we require it to work on - in this case, only on the main draw event:","\n  ","/// @function layer_shader_start();"," function layer_shader_start()\n    "," {\n    "," if event_type == ev_draw","    {\n    ","    if event_number == 0","       {\n    ","       colour_to_find = shader_get_uniform(sShaderDemo5, \"f_Colour1\");","       colour_to_set = shader_get_uniform(sShaderDemo5, \"f_Colour2\");","       shader_set(s_ColourChanger);\n    ","       shader_set_uniform_f(colour_to_find, 1,1,1 );","       shader_set_uniform_f(colour_to_set, 1,0,0 );","       }\n    ","    }\n    "," }\n  ","\n  ","We would then have a companion function to reset the shader after all the drawing is done:","\n  ","/// @function layer_shader_end();"," function layer_shader_end()\n    "," {\n    "," if event_type == ev_draw","    {\n    ","    if event_number == 0","       {\n    ","       shader_reset();\n    ","       }\n    ","    }\n    "," }\n  ","\n  ","Now that we have defined our script functions for setting the shader, we then have to assign them to a specific layer so that the layer knows to call them. This would be done in the room creation code, or in the create event or room start event of some\n    controller object (they do not need to be set every step, but rather once at the start of the room, or when the layer is initially created):","\n  ","var lay_id = layer_get_id(\"Instances\");"," layer_script_begin(lay_id, layer_shader_start);"," layer_script_end(lay_id, layer_shader_end);","\n  ","This final code block assigns the scripts to the layer.","\n  "," ","\n  "," ","\n  "," ","\n  ","\n    ","\n      ","\n        ","Back: ","General Layer Functions","\n        ","Next: ","layer_script_end","\n      ","\n    ","\n    ","\n  ","\n  ","\n  ","\n\n"],"4":["layer_script_begin"],"5":["© Copyright YoYo Games Ltd. 2020 All Rights Reserved"],"7":["Syntax:","Returns:","Extended Example:"],"id":"637"})
