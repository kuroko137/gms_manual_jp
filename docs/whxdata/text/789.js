The stepsize is also the distance \"ahead\"\n    that the object will check each step for a collision, and you can choose whether the instance stops at a collision with an object or instance of your choice.","\n  "," ","\n  ","\n  ","mp_linear_step_object(xgoal, ygoal, stepsize, obj);","\n  ","\n    ","\n      ","\n        ","Argument","\n        ","Description","\n      ","\n      ","\n        ","xgoal","\n        ","The target x position.","\n      ","\n      ","\n        ","ygoal","\n        ","The target y position.","\n      ","\n      ","\n        ","stepsize","\n        ","The speed the instance moves in pixels per step.","\n      ","\n      ","\n        ","obj","\n        ","The object that is to block the path.
