Surfaces are always held in texture memory which means that they can be destroyed from one moment to the next (for example, when a screensaver starts on windows, or\n    when minimised on an Android device), so you should always check that a surface exists before doing anything with it (this includes drawing it to the screen). The example code below shows a typical use of this command in the draw event of an instance\n    to check for a surface and re-create it if it has been removed (note that the surface will have been originally created in the create event of the object).","\n  "," ","\n  ","\n  ","surface_exists(surface_id);","\n  ","\n    ","\n      ","\n        ","Argument","\n        ","Description","\n      ","\n      ","\n        ","surface_id","\n        ","The ID of the surface to check.","\n      ","\n    ","\n  ","\n  "," ","\n  ","\n  ","Boolean","\n  "," ","\n  ","\n  ","if !surface_exists(surf)","     {\n    ","     surf = surface_create(1024, 1024);","     }\n    "," else\n    ","     {\n    ","     if view_current = 1","         {\n    ","         draw_surface(surf,0,0);\n    ","         }\n    ","     }\n  ","\n  ","The above code will check to see if a surface indexed in the variable \"surf\" exists, and if it does not, it will re-create it. If it does exist, it then checks to see which view is currently being drawn and if it is view[1] it draws the surface.","\n  "," ","\n  "," ","\n  "," ","\n  ","\n    ","\n      ","\n        ","Back: ","Surfaces","\n        ","Next: ","surface_create","\n      ","\n    ","\n    ","\n  ","\n  ","\n  ","\n\n"],"4":["surface_exists"],"5":["© Copyright YoYo Games Ltd. 2020 All Rights Reserved"],"7":["Syntax:","Returns:","Example:"],"id":"81"})
