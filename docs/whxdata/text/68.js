There are also a good number of different methods for detecting collisions between two instances, and which you choose will depend largely on the type of game you are making and the exact situation that you need to use the collision functions in. The following sections cover all of this and list all the functions related to movement, path-finding and collisions:","\n  "," ","\n  ","\n    ","Movement","\n    ","Motion Planning","\n    ","Collisions","\n  ","\n  "," ","\n  "," ","\n  "," ","\n  ","\n    ","\n      ","\n        ","Back: ","GML Reference","\n        ","Next: ","Drawing","\n      ","\n    ","\n    ","\n  ","\n  ","\n  ","\n\n"],"4":["Movement And Collisions"],"5":["© Copyright YoYo Games Ltd. 2020 All Rights Reserved"],"id":"68"})
