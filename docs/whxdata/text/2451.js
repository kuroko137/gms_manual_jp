The layer is specified from the layer name given (a string, as used to name the layer in the Room Editor), and then you give an x and y position to find the tile to get the index of. The tile\n    will be the one that the given position falls within in the room, and the index will be returned to the target variable, where 0 is no tile, and a positive integer is the index of the tile. The x and y position can be flagged as being relative to\n    the position of the calling instance, and the target variable can be flagged as a temporary (local) variable that can be used until the end of the event.","\n  "," ","\n  ","\n  ","\n  ","\n  \n    ","\n      ","\n        ","\n          ","Argument","\n          ","Description","\n        ","\n        ","\n          ","Layer","\n          ","The layer to set the tile on","\n        ","\n        ","\n          ","x","\n          ","The x position to check","\n        ","\n        ","\n          ","y","\n          ","The y position to check","\n        ","\n        ","\n          ","Target","\n          ","The target variable to store the tile index","\n        ","\n      ","\n    ","\n  \n  "," ","\n  ","\n  ","The above action block code checks for a mouse left button\n    press and if one is detected it gets the index of the tile cell that the position of the mouse falls within.
