If you are writing a file to disk, ","working_directory"," points to the area of local storage that is reserved for your game on the target\n    device (in windows this is \"","%LOCALAPPDATA%/gamedir/","\" where the \"gamedir\" is the directory with the name of your game). However, when reading from disk, ","working_directory"," can be ","either","    the local storage ","or"," the area where the included files are stored.","\n  ","NOTE",": The ","working_directory"," variable will return the path ","including"," the final backslash.","\n  ","For example, if you have a default ","*.txt"," file included with your game and read it into memory using ","working_directory",", then that file will be taken from the area where the included files are stored. If you then choose to write that\n    information to a text file using ","working_directory",", this will write the file to the target platforms local storage, where it will be read from the next time unless you instruct GameMaker Studio 2 to delete the file, in which case ","working_directory","    will once more point to the area where the included files are stored.","\n  ","It is worth noting that ","in general"," you do not need to use this and simply calling the file name (plus any additional path information) is sufficient, for example this:","\n  ","file_text_open_read(working_directory + \"my_file.txt\");","\n  ","would be better done as this:","\n  ","file_text_open_read(\"my_file.txt\");","\n  ","WARNING!"," This function may not work as you expect due to GameMaker Studio 2 being sandboxed!
