A compiler error happens when your game encounters some type of error that the syntax checker may not have been able to detect - it's very easy to\n    forget to declare a variable or mistakenly type a string as a real, for example - or when an error is related to how you have set up the compile tools from the ","Platform Preferences","    for the target platform. These errors will be caught by GameMaker Studio 2 as the game is being compiled and this information will also be shown in the ","Compiler Error Output",", as shown below:","\n  ","\n  ","NOTE",": These errors don't usually pop up a window and will simply show \"","Build Failed","\" in the compiler output. If a window pops up it's usually a Runner Error, which\n    is explained ","here",".","\n  ","The compiler error messages will all follow the same format:","\n  ","[object] - [event] - [Line Number]: [error string]","\n  ","If the error is found in a script then it will simply be:","\n  ","[script] - [Line Number]: [error string]","\n  ","You can then double-click "," on any of the compiler error entries to open the given asset at the position flagged as giving the error, and then you\n    can use the information contained within the message to pinpoint exactly where in the object or script the error has occurred. However, sometimes these errors can seem a bit cryptic, so below you can find a complete list of all errors and a brief\n    explanation of what they mean:","\n  "," ","\n  ","\n    ","\n      ","\n
