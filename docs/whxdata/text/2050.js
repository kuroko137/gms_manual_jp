However, we recommend that you revise all the compatibility scripts created in a project, and ensure that future\n    projects use the new functions/methods of working rather than depend on these scripts.","\n  "," ","\n  ","Backgrounds","Backgrounds","\n  ","\n    ","In legacy GameMaker you had a separate ","background ","resource, where you could add images to be used as backgrounds.

overheads to the function calls, resulting in poorer performance.\n      In GameMaker Studio 2 this has been changed, and now all actions compile to pure code (and can be shown as such if required),
