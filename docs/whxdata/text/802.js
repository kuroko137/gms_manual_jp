Cells are ","not"," calculated as room coordinates, but rather as grid coordinates, where (0,0) is the top let corner of the grid. this means that to clear a cell at a specific\n    position in the room, we must change the x and y coordinates into cell coordinate dividing them by the resolution of the MP grid. The code example below shows how this works.","\n  "," ","\n  ","\n  ","mp_grid_clear_cell(id, h, v);","\n  ","\n    ","\n      ","\n        ","Argument","\n        ","Description","\n      ","\n      ","\n        ","id","\n        ","Index of the mp_grid that is to be used","\n      ","\n      ","\n        ","h","\n        ","Horizontal position of the cell to clear","\n      ","\n      ","\n        ","v","\n        ","vertical position of the cell to clear","\n      ","\n    ","\n  ","\n  "," ","\n  ","\n  ","Boolean","\n  "," ","\n  ","\n  ","with (obj_Box)","     {\n    ","     mp_grid_clear_cell(grid, floor(x / 32), floor(y /32));","     instance_destroy();\n    ","     }\n  ","\n  ","The above code will make all \"obj_Box\" destroy themselves and have them mark the cells they occupied in the mp_grid indexed in the variable \"grid\" as free.
