The possible emitter shapes are:","\n  ","To define your shapes, you give the coordinates for a \"bounding box\" into which the given\n    shape will be placed (in the case of rectangle, ellipse and diamond shapes) or the first and second coordinates for the start and finish points (in the case of a line).
