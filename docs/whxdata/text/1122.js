When working with surfaces, it is often required that capture the ","whole"," visible region of the screen to the surface, and so you would assign it to a view port using\n    this function. This means that everything that is shown in the chosen port view will now be drawn to the assigned surface and the contents of that view port will no longer be displayed, meaning that you will need to either:","\n  ","\n    ","Enable a new view and draw the surface only in that view (using ","view_current"," to check which view is being drawn)","\n    ","Draw the surface in the Draw GUI event of an instance, since the GUI layer is independent of views.","\n  ","\n  ","When using this function you give the view port index (from 0 to 7) and a surface index (either the ","application_surface"," or the unique index value returned by the function ","surface_create()",")\n    or, if a surface has previously been assigned and you want to remove it, a value of -1.
