This is normally set in the ","Sprite Editor",", but there may be moments when you are required\n    to set this manually for a given sprite resource. You need to supply the sprite index to set, the animation speed and the type of animation speed to apply. The animation speed type can be any one of the following constants:","\n  ","\n  ","\n    ","\n      ","\n        ","Constant","\n        ","Description","\n      ","\n      ","\n        ","spritespeed_framespersecond","\n        ","The sprite was defined with animation in ","frames per second",".","\n      ","\n      ","\n        ","spritespeed_framespergameframe","\n        ","The sprite was defined with in animation in ","frames per game frame",".","\n      ","\n    ","\n  ","\n  "," Selecting the type of speed to use to calculate animations is very important as there is a huge difference between the two options.
