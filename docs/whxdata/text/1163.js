By default, the GUI layer is 1:1 with the application surface\n    resolution and drawn at the (0,0) position of the surface too. However this is not always what you want and so you can use this function to set it to be drawn relative to the absolute (0,0) position of the display or game window. What arguments you\n    provide to this function will depend on the effect you wish it to have on the GUI layer. Simply calling the function with no arguments will set the GUI layer to be drawn at the (0,0) position of the screen or game window, with the width and height\n    being scaled to fit the whole area:","\n  ","display_set_gui_maximise();","\n  ","However, you can set the ","scaling factor"," for the GUI layer, and the width and height will be scaled by that amount. Remember that the GUI layer is always made to fit the size of the display or game window, or the application surface, so setting\n    this value to anything other than 1 basically scales the pixel count along the width and height. If your display is 1024x768 and you set the scaling factor to scale by 0.5, then your GUI layer will be half the size of the display, effectively doubling\n    the pixel size:","\n  ","display_set_gui_maximise(0.5, 0.5);","\n  ","Setting the values in this way will also set the draw position to the (0,0) of the display or game window, so you can provide offset values to \"move\" the (0,0) position:","\n  ","var pos = application_get_position();"," display_set_gui_maximise(0.5, 0.5, pos[0], pos[1]);","\n  ","Finally, you can reset the GUI layer using this function by setting the scaling factors to -1. This will set the GUI layer to have a 1:1 scale again and set the draw position to the (0,0) position of the application surface rather than the display or\n    window.","\n  ","display_set_gui_maximise(-1, -1);","\n  "," ","\n  ","\n  ","display_set_gui_maximise(","xscale, yscale, xoffset, yoffset",");","\n  ","\n    ","\n      ","\n        ","Argument","\n        ","Description","\n      ","\n      ","\n        ","xscale","\n        ","<Optional>"," The horizontal scaling factor (use -1 to reset to default).","\n      ","\n      ","\n        ","yscale","\n        ","<Optional>"," The vertical scaling factor (use -1 to reset to default).","\n      ","\n      ","\n        ","xoffset","\n        ","<Optional>"," The x offset position for drawing.","\n      ","\n      ","\n        ","yoffset","\n        ","<Optional>"," The y offset position for drawing.","\n      ","\n    ","\n  ","\n  "," ","\n  ","\n  ","N/A","\n  "," ","\n  ","\n  ","display_set_gui_size(display_get_width() / 2, display_get_height() / 2);"," display_set_gui_maximise(2, 2, 0, 0);","\n  ","The above code will lock the draw GUI event to the given width and height, scaling all components to fit the display, using that proportion.","\n  "," ","\n  "," ","\n  "," ","\n  ","\n    ","\n      ","Cameras And Display","\n        ","Back: ","\n        ","Next: ","display_set_ui_visibility","\n      ","\n    ","\n    ","\n  ","\n  ","\n  ","\n\n"],"4":["display_set_gui_maximise"],"5":["© Copyright YoYo Games Ltd. 2020 All Rights Reserved"],"7":["Syntax:","Returns:","Example:"],"id":"1163"})
