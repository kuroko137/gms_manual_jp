You can get or set this struct, and so change the base\n      sequence that the instance is referencing.","\n    ","headPosition",": This is the current ","playhead"," position (in frames) for the sequence instance. You can get or set this value, but note that setting it to a value greater or less than\n      the currently defined play region will have different effects depending on the type of playback set for the sequence. See ","layer_sequence_headpos()"," for more information.","\n    ","headDirection",": This is the current playback direction for the sequence instance.
