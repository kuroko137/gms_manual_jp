The goal of the gesture system is to try and recognise inputs at a higher level than the direct mouse\\touch reading functions, and is designed to simplify the\n    implementation of commonly used inputs on touch-based devices.","\n  ","NOTE: These events will not be triggered on the HTML5 platform due to lack of support for multi-touch using these events on that platform. If you are looking for gestures on that target then you should be using the ","device functions",".","\n  ","You can choose to detect either ","instance ","gestures or ","global ","gestures, where instance gesture events will only be triggered when the initial touch/click is on an instance within the room. Note that the instance must\n    have a valid collision mask (see ","The Sprite Editor - Collision Mask"," and ","The Object Editor - Collision Mask"," sections for more details) for this event to be triggered. Global events, however,\n    will be triggered by touching/clicking anywhere within the game room, and for all instances that have the event.","\n  ","When a gesture is recognised, it will trigger one or more of the available events, and the event triggered will depend on the type of gesture that has been detected. In every case, however, a ","DS Map"," will\n    be generated for you and stored in the built-in variable ","event_data",". The keys available will depend on which kind of event it has been created by and are shown in each of the sub-sections below.","\n  ","NOTE",": The variable ","event_data"," is only valid in these events, as the DS map that it points to is automatically created at the start of the event, then destroyed again at the end, with this variable being reset\n    to a value of -1 at all other times.","\n  ","It is worth noting that if you have multiple instances under the position being touched and they all have a gesture event, then ","all ","of them will trigger, not just the \"topmost\" instance. Also note that when using multiple camera views\n    and dragging an instance, the values returned will be based on the view you were in when the initial touch/click was received - this is true for all subsequent events in that gesture for that instance. So touching and dragging an instance in one view\n    then releasing the touch in another view, will return values relative to the initial view where the gesture was first detected.","\n  "," ","\n  ","  ","  ","Tap, Drag, And Flick Events","Tap, Drag, And Flick Events","\n  ","\n    ","The \"Tap\", \"Drag\" and \"Flick\" events are all based on a single touch or mouse click on the screen and the ","event_data"," DS Map will contain the following keys:","\n    ","\n    ","\n    ","\n      ","\n        ","\n          ","Key","\n          ","Description","\n        ","\n        ","\n          ","\"","gesture","\"","\n          "," This is an ID value that is ","unique"," to the gesture that is in play.
