You can pass into the shader up to eight 32bit colour values and they will automatically be converted for you into vec4 values of 0 - 1. However for this you ","must"," use\n    the shader constant name ","in_Colour",", for a single colour, or ","in_Colour0",", ","in_Colour1",", etc... up to ","in_Colour7"," for multiple input values.
