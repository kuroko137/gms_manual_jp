The function takes the ","socket id"," to connect through (see ","network_create_socket()",") and requires you to give the IP address to connect\n    to (a string) as well as the port to connect through, and if the connection fails a value of less than 0 will be returned. The connection uses a special protocol that ensures only GameMaker Studio 2 games connect to each other, however if you need\n    to connect to a server that is not a GameMaker Studio 2 game, you can use ","network_connect_async_raw()",".
