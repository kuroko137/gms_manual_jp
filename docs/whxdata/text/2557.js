You give the type of expression to check with and the value to check the current ","lives"," against, and the \"if\" statement will\n    always return either ","true"," or ","false"," depending on the expressions and values used. The available expressions are:","\n  ","\n    ","Equals to"," - The variable and the value are both exactly equal","\n    ","Less than"," - The variable is less than the value","\n    ","Greater than"," - The variable is greater than the value","\n    ","Less than or Equal to"," - The variable is less than ","or"," equal to the value","\n    ","Greater than or Equal to"," - The variable is greater than ","or"," equal to the value","\n  ","\n  ","If you flag the ","Not"," argument, then the above will be ","negated expressions",", for example \"equals to\" becomes \"","not"," equals to\", so you would be checking if the ","lives"," value is not equals to the given value.","\n  ","IMPORTANT NOTE",": Due to ","floating point precision issues",", checking to see if two values are exactly equal may return ","false",", since one may be exactly 1, while\n    the other may be 1.00000000000001.
