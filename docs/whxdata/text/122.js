When\n    the information ","callback"," is received a special ","Async Event"," is fired which, in turn, allows any instance with an Async Event assigned to it to execute further functions (although this\n    does not have to be the case). So, basically, it's a way to communicate with some external resource (server, user or device) without the game or project stopping while waiting for a reply.","\n  ","Why is this important? Well, since it allows GameMaker Studio 2 to continue functioning while sending or receiving data, and this means that you can do many things all without blocking the game loop like:","\n  ","\n    ","stream data from the device into your game without the player waiting for things to load","\n    ","have callback events to do things only when the correct information is received","\n    ","communicate and interchange data with a web server","\n  ","\n  ","This makes everything function in a much more fluid and unobtrusive way. It should be noted that the Async Events will be triggered for ","all ","instances that have them, so you can use an async function in one instance, and have the Asynchronous\n    Event that deals with the reply in another one, or even various other ones.
