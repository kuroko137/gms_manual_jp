The options available are:","\n  ","\n    ","Automatic response to DnD™ conversion to GameMaker Language",": When you use the right mouse button  "," menu option on a timeline moment\n      to convert Drag and Drop™ actions into script (code) you will get a prompt asking you if you wish to continue, since this is a one way conversion. Changing this option to \"Okay\" will suppress the message and go ahead with the conversion\n      as if you'd clicked \"Okay\" in the dialog. The default setting is \"Show Message\".","\n    ","A ","utomatic response to permanent action warning",": Certain actions within a timeline cannot be undone, and when that happens you will recieve a warning message asking you if you want to continue. Changing this option to \"Okay\"\n      will suppress the message and go ahead with the action as if you'd clicked \"Okay\" in the dialog. The default setting is \"Show Message\".","\n    ","Open new moments for edit on creation",": Normally when you add a new moment to a timeline, GameMaker Studio 2 will automatically open the editor for you to add your code or Drag and Drop to it. However if you un-check this option, the\n      moment will be added without opening the editor (you can open it by double clicking "," on the moment). By default this option is on.","\n  ","\n  "," ","\n  "," ","\n  "," ","\n  ","\n    ","\n      ","\n        ","Back: ","IDE Preferences","\n        ","Next: ","Extension Editor Preferences","\n      ","\n    ","\n    ","\n  ","\n  ","\n  ","\n\n"],"4":["Timeline Preferences"],"5":["© Copyright YoYo Games Ltd. 2020 All Rights Reserved"],"id":"2026"})
