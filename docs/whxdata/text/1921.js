You supply the user ID (as returned, for example, by the function ","xboxlive_get_user()","), the\n    stat string (as defined when you created it using the xboxlive_stats_set_stat_* functions), and then you specify a number of details about what leaderboard information you want to retrieve. Note that you can only retrieve a social leaderboard for\n    int or real stats, but not for string stats, and that if you flag the \"favourites_only\" argument as true, then the results will only contain data for those friends that are marked by the user as \"favourites\".","\n  ","IMPORTANT!"," Stats used in social leaderboards do ","not"," need to be registered as \"Featured Stats\" in the XDP/Windows Dev Center..","\n  ","The function will generate a callback which will trigger a ","System Asynchronous Event",".
