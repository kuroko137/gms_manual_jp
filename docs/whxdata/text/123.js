The function requires\n    the full IP address of the server to request from as well as the type of request to make (as a string, see the note below): \"GET\", \"HEAD\", \"POST\", \"PUT\", \"DELETE\", \"TRACE\", \"OPTIONS\",\n    or \"CONNECT\". You will also need to supply a ","DS map"," of key/value pairs (as strings, where the key is the header field and the value is the required data for the header), and\n    the final argument is an optional data string that you can add to the request, and if it's not needed then it can be either 0 or an empty string \"\". Note that you can also send a buffer (see the section on ","Buffers","    for more details), in which case the last argument would be the \"handle\" of the buffer to send.","\n  ","NOTE",": HTTP headers normally follow the format \"key:value\", but since GMS creates these pairs for you from the ds_map, there is no need to include the colon \":\" in your map key or value strings.","\n  ","NOTE",": When using a buffer for the body argument, if the buffer seek position is at the start (0) then no body is sent and the buffer is filled with the response from the http call, but if the buffer seek position is non-zero, then the buffer\n    string content is sent as the body.","\n  ","NOTE",": You should be aware that due to XSS protection in browsers, requests to and attempts to load resources from across domains are blocked and may appear to return blank results. Please see the part on ","Cross Domain Issues","    for further details.","\n  ","This event will generate a \"call back\" which is picked up by any ","HTTP Events",", in which case it will generate a ","DS Map"," (more commonly known as a \"dictionary\")\n    that is exclusive to this event and is stored in the special variable ","async_load",". This DS map has the following two keys related to the request function:","\n  ","\n    ","id: ","The ID which was returned from the command.
