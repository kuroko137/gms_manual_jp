This file can be either an included file or part of an extension. You supply the name (and path) of the file, then the name of the function\n    that you wish to define. Next you need to define the calling convention to be used (see the constants list below) as well as the type of result to be expected (also a constant, as listed below). Finally you must give the number arguments that the\n    function can take (from 0 to 15) and for each of the arguments you must specify its type too.
