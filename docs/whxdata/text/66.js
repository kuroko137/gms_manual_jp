So,\n    when you add a sequence to a layer in a room, you are creating an ","instance"," of the base sequence object, and this sequence instance is added as an ","element"," within a room layer.

This is important, as the functions listed below will reference the sequence ","element ID"," (the ID\n    of the sequence ","on the layer",") as well as the sequence ","instance ID"," (the actual ID of the sequence that is being referenced by the element) and the sequence data ","struct"," (which\n    contains all the sequence data).","\n  ","Below is a list of all the functions that can be used for editing sequences that have been added to an ","asset layer",":","\n  "," ","\n  ","\n    ","layer_sequence_exists","\n    ","layer_sequence_create","\n    ","layer_sequence_destroy","\n    ","layer_sequence_x","\n    ","layer_sequence_y","\n    ","layer_sequence_angle","\n    ","layer_sequence_xscale","\n    ","layer_sequence_yscale","\n    ","layer_sequence_headpos","\n    ","layer_sequence_headdir","\n    ","layer_sequence_pause","\n    ","layer_sequence_play","\n    ","layer_sequence_speedscale","\n    ","layer_sequence_get_x","\n    ","layer_sequence_get_y","\n    ","layer_sequence_get_angle","\n    ","layer_sequence_get_xscale","\n    ","layer_sequence_get_yscale","\n    ","layer_sequence_get_headpos","\n    ","layer_sequence_get_headdir","\n    ","layer_sequence_get_speedscale","\n    ","layer_sequence_get_length","\n    ","layer_sequence_get_instance","\n    ","layer_sequence_get_sequence","\n    ","layer_sequence_is_paused","\n    ","layer_sequence_is_finished","\n  ","\n  "," ","\n  ","There are also additional functions available for dealing with the contents of sequences and for defining your own.
