When you use this you are effectively asking GameMaker Studio 2    to move the instance to the new position, check for a collision, move back and tell you if a collision was found or not. This will work for precise collisions, but only if both the instance and the object being checked for have precise collision masks\n    selected otherwise only bounding box collisions are applied. this function will return the unique instance ","id"," of the object being collided, but if that is not needed it is slightly faster to use the\n    function ","place_meeting()",". This function also accepts the special keywords ","all"," and ","other"," and will\n    return the ","keyword"," ","noone"," if no collision occurs, or the unique instance ID value of the instance found if a collision does occur.","\n  ","Note that the given x/y coordinates will be rounded to the nearest integer before the check is performed, so if this is ","not"," what you require (or you have been using a legacy GameMaker product), you should ","floor"," the coordinates in the\n    check:","\n  ","instance_place_list(floor(x), floor(y), obj_Enemy, list, true).","\n  "," ","\n  ","\n  ","instance_place(x, y, obj);","\n  ","\n    ","\n      ","\n        ","Argument","\n        ","Description","\n      ","\n      ","\n        ","x","\n        ","The x position to check for instances.","\n      ","\n      ","\n        ","y","\n        ","The y position to check for instances.","\n      ","\n      ","\n        ","obj","\n        ","The object to check for instances of.","\n      ","\n    ","\n  ","\n  "," ","\n  ","\n  ","Real (either an instance ID value or the keyword ","noone",")","\n  "," ","\n  ","\n  ","var _inst = instance_place(x, y, obj_Enemy);"," if _inst != noone","     {\n    ","     hp -= _inst.dmg;","     instance_destroy(_inst);\n    ","     }\n  ","\n  ","The above code will check for a collision with instances of \"obj_Enemy\" and if there is one, it will reduce the \"hp\" variable by the amount stored in the colliding instance's \"dmg\" variable and then destroy the colliding\n    instance.","\n  "," ","\n  "," ","\n  "," ","\n  ","\n    ","\n      ","\n        ","Back: ","Instances","\n        ","Next: ","instance_place_list","\n      ","\n    ","\n    ","\n  ","\n  ","\n  ","\n\n"],"4":["instance_place"],"5":["© Copyright YoYo Games Ltd. 2020 All Rights Reserved"],"7":["Syntax:","Returns:","Example:"],"id":"575"})
