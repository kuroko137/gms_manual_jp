The position will affect the sound in different ways depending on where the ","listener"," is positioned within the audio space\n    too (default position is (0, 0, 0). See ","audio_listener_position()"," for more information), so for example if the emitter position is set to (100, 0, 0) and\n    the current listener is at (200, 0, 0) the audio streamed from the emitter will appear to be on the left of the audio field.
