You then supply the name of the channel, as a string, and the function will return the index value associated with that channel. Note that if the curve or channel does\n    not exist then you will get an error.","\n  "," ","\n  ","\n  ","animcurve_get_channel_index(curve_struct_or_id, channel_name);","\n  ","\n    ","\n      ","\n        ","Argument","\n        ","Description","\n      ","\n      ","\n        ","curve_struct_or_id","\n        ","The ID or struct pointer of the animation curve to target","\n      ","\n      ","\n        ","channel_name","\n        ","The channel name (a string).","\n      ","\n    ","\n  ","\n  "," ","\n  ","\n  ","Struct","\n  "," ","\n  ","\n  ","var _channelindex = animcurve_get_channel_index(ac_ButtonTween, \"x_pos\")"," var _channeldata = animcurve_get_channel(ac_ButtonTween, _channelindex);"," var _points = _channeldata.points;"," for (var i = 0; i < array_length(_points);\n    ++i;)","     {\n    ","     _points[i].value += 1;","     }\n  ","\n  ","The above code retrieves the channel struct for the channel named \"x_pos\" in the curve asset \"ac_ButtonTween\", then loops through the points on the channel curve and adds one to their value.","\n  "," ","\n  "," ","\n  "," ","\n  ","\n    ","\n      ","\n        ","Back: ","Animation Curves","\n        ","Next: ","animcurve_channel_evaluate","\n      ","\n    ","\n    ","\n  ","\n  ","\n  ","\n\n"],"4":["animcurve_get_channel_index"],"5":["© Copyright YoYo Games Ltd. 2020 All Rights Reserved"],"7":["Syntax:","Returns:","Example:"],"id":"251"})
