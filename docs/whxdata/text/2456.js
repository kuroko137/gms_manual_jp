The tile data is simply a value that reflects the index of the tile along with the flip, mirror, and rotate values, as well as any custom tile masks that\n    you have used. With this action you first supply the layer to target using the name of the layer (a string) as defined in the room editor, and then the x and y axis in the room to get the tile-data for. The tile data value returned will coincide with\n    whatever tile-map cell happens to be at that point. For example, if your tile-set tiles are 16x16, then the tile-map layer will hold tiles in cells of 16x16 pixels, so if you use this action to target the room position (8, 8), you will be getting\n    the tile-data for the cell (0, 0) of the tile-map.","\n  ","NOTE",": The layer selected ","must"," have been defined as a Tile Map Layer in the room editor, otherwise you may get errors.","\n  ","The returned value will then be stored in the target variable which can have been created previously or can be a new temporary one (if you check the \"Temp\" check-box).
