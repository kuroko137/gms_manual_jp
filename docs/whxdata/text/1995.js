However the ","Liquid Fun"," extension adds ","particles"," to\n    the physics system, which permit the creation of simulated soft-bodies using rigid body physics. Basically, you can create a ","shape"," of particles that maintain cohesion and so simulate a full body, which, due to the\n    interaction of the particles, gives the impression of a soft body. You can also use the physics particles to simulate liquids and other particle based physics systems.","\n  ","Before you start to create your physics particles you will need to set the basic physics properties for them, as you would a ","fixture"," in the regular physics. Note though that setting these properties will affect ","all particles created previously"," as\n    well as any new particles that you create, so you would normally only use these functions at the start of the game or level. However there are specific functions available to set the particle ","flags"," for individual particles\n    (and groups of particles) which will change their properties like \"bounciness\" or \"viscosity\", enabling you to create different types of particle within the ranges of these global settings.","\n  ","The following functions are available for setting and getting global particle system data:","\n  "," ","\n  ","\n    ","physics_particle_count","\n    ","physics_particle_group_count","\n    ","physics_particle_set_max_count","\n    ","physics_particle_set_radius","\n    ","physics_particle_set_density","\n    ","physics_particle_set_damping","\n    ","physics_particle_set_gravity_scale","\n    ","physics_particle_get_max_count","\n    ","physics_particle_get_radius","\n    ","physics_particle_get_density","\n    ","physics_particle_get_damping","\n    ","physics_particle_get_gravity_scale","\n  ","\n  "," ","\n  ","You also have the following functions available for setting ","flags"," on individual particles (or groups of particles), as well as for getting information, like position or colour, from a single particle or a single group:","\n  "," ","\n  ","\n    ","physics_particle_set_flags","\n    ","physics_particle_set_category_flags","\n    ","physics_particle_set_group_flags","\n    ","physics_particle_get_group_flags","\n    ","physics_particle_group_get_inertia","\n    ","physics_particle_group_get_centre_x","\n    ","physics_particle_group_get_centre_y","\n    ","physics_particle_group_get_vel_x","\n    ","physics_particle_group_get_vel_y","\n    ","physics_particle_group_get_ang_vel","\n    ","physics_particle_group_get_x","\n    ","physics_particle_group_get_y","\n    ","physics_particle_group_get_angle","\n    ","physics_particle_get_data","\n    ","physics_particle_get_data_particle","\n    ","physics_particle_group_get_data","\n  ","\n  "," ","\n  ","You can create particles in two ways - individually or in groups.
