There are two forces which can be used and applied to your fixtures:","\n  ","\n    ","Impulses",": An impulse will set the direction and velocity ","immediately"," after it is applied, making it ideal for things like springs, or shooting bullets, etc...","\n    ","Forces",": A force will act on the existing velocity and direction and change it over time, making it ideal for things like wind, or a magnet, etc...","\n    ","Torque",": Torque governs the likelihood for an instance to keep rotating around its axis after a force has been applied, and the speed at which it will stop rotating. Adding torque is a gradual process, much like using a force to add movement.","\n    ","Angular Impulse",": An angular impulse can be used to set a fixture spinning instantly, much like a regular impulse can be used to set a fixture instantly in movement.","\n  ","\n  ","The following functions exist to apply different types of forces to physics enabled instances, and each function gives a fuller explanation of how the force will be applied than the outlines given above:","\n  "," ","\n  ","\n    ","physics_apply_force","\n    ","physics_apply_impulse","\n    ","physics_apply_local_force","\n    ","physics_apply_local_impulse","\n    ","physics_apply_torque","\n    ","physics_apply_angular_impulse","\n  ","\n  "," ","\n  "," ","\n  "," ","\n  ","\n    ","\n      ","\n        ","Back: ","Physics","\n        ","Next: ","Fixtures","\n      ","\n    ","\n    ","\n  ","\n  ","\n  ","\n\n"],"4":["Forces"],"5":["© Copyright YoYo Games Ltd. 2020 All Rights Reserved"],"id":"113"})
