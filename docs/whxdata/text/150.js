These functions are require you to have checked the ","Enable XBox Live"," option in the ","UWP Game Options",".\n    Some of these functions require the user to be signed-in to XBox Live, which GameMaker Studio 2 will try to do automatically when you run the project. This \"silent\" sign in will generate a ","System Asynchronous Event","    which can the be checked to see if it was successful or not before proceeding. Note that unlike the Xbox One Console export, the UWP export for XBox Live only permits one user to be signed-in at a time.","\n  ","IMPORTANT!"," The UWP target only has a minimum of support for XBox Live when set up as part of the ","Creator Program",", which is limited to some basic user and account functions (see ","here","    for more information on setting this up).
