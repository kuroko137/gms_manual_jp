For example, if the current user is number 5 on a given leaderboard, then setting the start range to -2 and the end range to\n    2 will return 5 entries: 3 through 7. If there are not enough entries in the leaderboard before or after the user's entry, Steam will adjust the range to try to return the number of entries requested. For example, if the user is #1 on the leaderboard,\n    start is set to -2, and end is set to 2, Steam will return the first 5 entries in the leaderboard.","\n  "," ","\n  ","\n  ","steam_download_scores_around_user(lb_name, range_start, range_end);","\n  ","\n    ","\n      ","\n        ","Argument","\n        ","Description","\n      ","\n      ","\n        ","lb_name","\n        ","The name of the leaderboard that you are downloading the scores from (a string).","\n      ","\n      ","\n        ","range_start","\n        ","The start position within the leaderboard.","\n      ","\n      ","\n        ","range_end","\n        ","The end position within the leaderboard.","\n      ","\n    ","\n  ","\n  "," ","\n  ","\n  ","Real","\n  "," ","\n  ","\n  ","score_get = steam_download_scores_around_user(\"Game Scores\", -4, 5);","\n  ","This will send off a request to the Steam Server for a range of 10 scores from the leaderboard \"Game Scores\", centered on the player and will store the ","async id"," of the request in the variable \"score_get\".
