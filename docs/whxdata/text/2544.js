You can use negative values to signify that the instance should follow the path in reverse and it's worth noting that the speed you set here can be modified by the speed modifier set in the path editor for each path point, so if you\n    set a path speed to 2 and in the path one of the points has a speed modifier of 200% the actual pixels per game frame speed at that point will be 4.","\n  "," ","\n  ","\n  ","\n  ","\n  ","\n    ","\n      ","\n        ","Argument","\n        ","Description","\n      ","\n      ","\n        ","Speed","\n        ","The speed (in pixels per game frame) that the instance should follow the path","\n      ","\n    ","\n  ","\n  "," ","\n  ","\n  ","The above action block code starts an instance following a path, then generates a random\n    value between 2 and 4 before using this value to set the speed that the instance moves along the path at.","\n  "," ","\n  "," ","\n  "," ","\n  ","\n    ","\n      ","\n        ","Back: ","Path Actions","\n        ","Next: ","Get Path Follow Speed","\n      ","\n    ","\n    ","\n  ","\n  ","\n  ","\n\n"],"4":[" Set Path Follow Speed"],"5":["© Copyright YoYo Games Ltd. 2020 All Rights Reserved"],"7":["Action Syntax:","Arguments:","Example:"],"id":"2544"})
