Each component of the colours is stored as a floating point value between 0 and 1, and the new colour is calculated by multiply each component of the\n    source colour by some factor and by multiplying each component of destination colour by some other factor and then adding the results together component by component.","\n  ","This function permits you to set the blend mode in four basic ways using the following constants:","\n  ","\n    ","\n      ","\n        ","Constant","\n        ","Description","\n        ","Extended Blend Mode","\n      ","\n      ","\n        ","bm_normal","\n        ","Normal blending (the default blend mode).","\n        ","(","bm_src_alpha",", ","bm_inv_src_alpha",")","\n      ","\n      ","\n        ","bm_add","\n        ","Additive blending.
