However, if it's\n      domain wide authentication you want (ie: \"","bitbucket.org","\" or \"","github.com","\" ) then just place the domain and nothing else. When something needs to check for authentication,\n      it will look for a specific repository match first, and then a domain match. This will allow you to have a default authentication for a domain, and override with specific details for certain repositories later.","\n  ","\n  ","NOTE: If you are using an external repository, then you should be using the username and password associated with the account set up for that repository, but if you are wanting to use a local repository then you can use any username and password.","\n  ","\n    ","SSH Keypairs",": Clicking the \"","Add New SSH Keypair Authentication","\" will present you with the following window where you can input the ","Repository URL"," and ","Password"," before giving the\n      paths to the ","Public Key"," and ","Private Key"," files required:","\n      ","Like the Username/Password authentications, you can have domain and repository specific authentications when using SSH keypairs. If you already have an\n      SSH Keypair generated, you can set the paths up here, as well as any password required to access them. Note that should you need quick access to the public key, the copy button "," will automatically copy the contents to the clipboard for you. If you don't already have an SSH Keypair, clicking on the ","Create KeyPair"," button will bring up a file dialog of where to place the private key, and\n      the public key will be created adjacent to it - this will fill out the paths to the public and private keys automatically for you.","\n  ","\n  ","These settings will now be used to communicate with the repository (IE: Git Hub, Bit Bucket, etc.. ) when handling clone, push and pull requests. However you still need to set up the per-project options which can be done by opening up the ","Main Options","    and clicking the ","Enable Source Control"," option. This will activate SCM for the current project.","\n  ","Once you have enabled source control (and applied it) a new context menu will appear at the top of the IDE with the following option (each\n    of which is explained in more detail in the rest of the sections of this tutorial):","\n  ","\n  ","NOTE",": If you need to edit the authentication details again, just double click on the entry and the details window will open for you to edit, but you will not be able to rename the URL. If you need to change the URL then you will need\n    to delete the authentication details and re-add. To delete the authentication details, click on the close button on the left of the row in the main Preferences window.","\n  ","\n  "," ","\n  "," ","\n  "," ","\n  ","\n    ","\n      ","\n        ","Back: ","Source Control","\n        ","Next: ","Repository Options"," ","\n      ","\n    ","\n    ","\n  ","\n  ","\n  ","\n\n"],"4":["Setting Up The GIT Plugin"],"5":["© Copyright YoYo Games Ltd. 2020 All Rights Reserved"],"id":"2261"})
