You must previously have opened the Ini file for reading/writing using the action ","Open Ini File",", and then with this action you give the type of data to read\n    (either a real number or a string enclosed in \"\"), as well as the section header and the key within that section to get the data from. You can also supply a default value which can be either a real number of a string, and the type should\n    coincide with the \"Type\" set in the action. This default action will be returned by the action should any of the following occur:","\n  ","\n    ","The Ini file you have opened does not exist","\n    ","The section header you reference does not exist","\n    ","The key you are trying to get data from does not exist","\n  ","\n  ","Under any of the above circumstances, you will get the default value returned rather than a value from the Ini file.
