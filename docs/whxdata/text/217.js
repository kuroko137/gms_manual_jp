It should be noted that the ","execution of the function ends at the ","return"," statement",", meaning that any code which comes after ","return"," has been called will not be run. Here is a short\n    example script called ","sqr_calc"," which calculates the square of whatever value is passed to it, and it includes error catching in case the parameter that it is passed is not a real number:","\n  ","/// @function            sqr_calc(val);"," /// @param {real}  val   The value to calculate the square of"," /// @description         Calculate the square of the given value","\n    "," function sqr_calc(value)","     {\n    ","     if !is_real(value)","         {\n    ","         return 0;","         }\n    ","     else\n    ","         {\n    ","         return (value * value);","         }\n    ","     }\n  ","\n  ","To call a function from within a piece of code, just use it the same way as when calling runtime functions - that is, write the function name with the parameter values in parentheses. So, the above function would be called like this:","\n  ","if keyboard_check_pressed(vk_enter)","     {\n    ","     val = scr_sqr(amount);","     }\n  ","\n  ","Here the variable ","val"," will either be 0 (because the variable ","amount"," is not a real number) or the total for ","value * value",".","\n  "," ","\n  "," ","\n  "," ","\n  ","\n    ","\n      ","\n        ","Back: ","Language Features","\n        ","Next: ","begin / end","\n      ","\n    ","\n    ","\n  ","\n  ","\n  ","\n\n"],"4":["return"],"5":["© Copyright YoYo Games Ltd. 2020 All Rights Reserved"],"id":"217"})
