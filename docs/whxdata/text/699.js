You give the background element ID (which you get when you create a background element using ","layer_background_create()","    or when you use the function ","layer_background_get_id()","), and then set the scale value. The scale value you give is a multiplier that will be used to change the way the background element is displayed,\n    where a value of 0.5 would display the element at half scale, and a value of 2 would display at double scale. Note that negative values are valid, and will \"flip\" the element around the (0,0) position, so an x scale of -1 would show the\n    image reversed.","\n  "," ","\n  ","\n  ","layer_background_yscale(background_element_id, yscale);","\n  ","\n    ","\n      ","\n        ","Argument","\n        ","Description","\n      ","\n      ","\n        ","background_element_id","\n        ","The unique ID value of the background element to change","\n      ","\n      ","\n        ","speed","\n        ","The speed multiplier/value to use for the element","\n      ","\n    ","\n  ","\n  "," ","\n  ","\n  ","N/A","\n  "," ","\n  ","\n  ","var lay_id = layer_get_id(\"Background_water\");"," var back_id = layer_background_get_id(lay_id);"," layer_background_yscale(back_id, -1);","\n  ","The above code will get the layer ID for the layer named \"Background_water\" and then use that to get the ID of the background element on that layer.
