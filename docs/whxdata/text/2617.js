If you have used any other image tools then this should be familiar to you but there are a few things to note when using the GameMaker Studio 2 image editor which may not be immediately apparent:","\n  ","\n    ","When you create multiple frames, you can draw to them as they animate! So, if you press the play button"," on the ","Frame Control","      bar, and then select a brush and start to draw in the editor window, you'll see that the frames will animate in the editor and what you draw will be added to the corresponding frame in that moment. You can experiment with different frame rates\n      until you get something you like, but once you've got the hang of how this works you'll be creating dynamic sprites and effects in no time.","\n    ","You can pull the Image Editor tab off of the main workspace window into it's own window. This can be handy when using multiple monitors, for example.","\n    ","When you use the ","Copy ","functions to, for example, copy a selection of an image, then the selection copied gets added to your ","brush list",". This means that you can select a part of an image and then use it in the rest of the\n      paint tools to draw lines, polygons or just paint freely. The brush can be scaled and blended with a colour too. Note that the ","Paste ","functionality is not intended for use internally within the editor as anything you copy is added to the\n      brush list and so can be selected for \"pasting\" that way. Instead paste is simply for you to capture something from an external program and paste it into the Image Editor.","\n    ","You can have multiple layers for each sprite thanks to the handy ","layer editor",". These layers can ordered and even placed in folders to make creating more complex images easier.","\n    ","You can quickly change between sub-images (frames) in the editor by using the \"","1","\" and \"","2","\" keys on the keyboard.","\n  ","\n  ","Those are just some of the more advanced features that the image editor offers. To find out the full feature range, please read the items below detailing the functions of every part of the editor:","\n  ","Frame View","Frame View","\n  ","\n    ","This part of the window shows the frames in the order that they will be animated in. You can click the "," button to the left to add further frames - or use the\n      ","Image Menu"," - and you can also click and drag any of the frames to change their position along the timeline. In the top left of the Frame View you can switch on ","Onion Skinning"," ",", which means that in a single frame of any sprite animation, you can choose to see any of the preceding or succeeding frames as a semi-transparent layer under the image frame\n      you are currently editing. The great thing about this is that each frame is drawn slightly lighter than the last so you can see how the animation has been progressing from frame to frame while drawing the next one.","\n    ","Enabling this will show some extra controls over the frames which you can click "," and drag to set the number of preceding frames to show as well as\n      the number of following frames.","\n    ","You can set certain properties for onion-skinning from the ","View"," conext menu, which is explained further down this page.","\n    ","Beneath the Onion Skin button, you have the ","Loop Control"," button "," used to set whether the sprite loops (goes back to\n      frame 1 when the last frame is reached) or ping-pongs (goes backwards through the frames when the last frame is reached). The Play button "," at\n      the bottom is for starting/stopping the preview of the animation.","\n    ","You can click on any frame to select it for editing, and a selected frame will have a Delete button "," at the top corner which you can click to remove the\n      frame from the sprite. You can also click "," / "," + "," on multiple frames to select them together, in which case clicking the Delete button will delete all the selected frames. Finally, you can\n      use the standard keyboard shortcuts for ","Cut",", ","Copy ","and ","Paste ","to edit selected frames: "," / "," + \"","X","\", "," / "," + \"","C","\", and "," / "," + \"","V","\".","\n    "," ","\n  ","\n  ","Frame Information","Frame Information","\n  ","\n    ","This bar contains the ","Frame Information",". Here you can set the speed at which the animation frames should be played back using the input box on the left. The frame speed can either be based on \"","Frames per second","\",\n      or \"","Frames per game frame","\". The total number of frames available are shown to the right along with the current frame that has been selected, and you can collapse this bar (hide it) by clicking on the "," icon to the left. You can set this to always start open or always start closed from the ","Image Editor Preferences",".","\n    ","Note that the value used here for the animation speed will also set the way the sprite is animated when used in a game, either as a sprite asset on a layer or as a sprite assigned to an instance, although you can modify this at runtime using the appropriate\n      ","functions"," and ","variables",".","\n    "," ","\n  ","\n  ","Canvas Controls","Canvas Controls","\n  ","\n    ","The canvas controls deal with various aspects of how the main draw canvas and its contents are displayed. The options are:","\n    ","\n      ","Toggle Canvas Grid ",": This will toggle on/off the canvas grid. This is a grid that GameMaker Studio 2 draws over the main canvas to divide it into sections,\n        and by default is set to 1px in size. However if you click the Grid Menu icon "," you will open the grid options:","\n        ","These options permit you to set the grid colour and alpha, as well as the cell values for the grid along the X and Y axis.\n        You also have an option to enable or disable grid snapping here (disabled by default).","\n      ","Canvas Zoom Controls ",": These buttons control the current canvas zoom level. You can zoom in or out and clicking the "," button will reset the canvas to be 1:1 with the image being edited. You can also click the Window Fit button "," to make the entire image canvas fit within the current editor workspace (this will zoom in/out as appropriate to make it fit). Note that you can also zoom in and out using the "," / "," and the Mouse Wheel ",", and pressing "," / "," + "," will set the room canvas to be 1:1 with the image.","\n      ","Split Canvas ",": Clicking this will cycle between splitting the canvas horizontally, vertically keeping it a single a single canvas.\n        When in split canvas view, each canvas will have its own set of Canvas controls so you can zoom one in and the other out, for example, and you can edit either canvas with the changes being reflected in the other canvas. To change the canvas view\n        toggle, you can click the Split Options "," button and select the one you wish to use or simply click the Split Canvas button until\n        it cycles to the one you want.","\n    ","\n    "," ","\n  ","\n  ","Draw Canvas","Draw Canvas","\n  ","\n    ","This is the main editing window for your images.

If cutting a selection, this will add it to the brushes.","\n      ","Copy Frame"," / ","Selection ","- Copy the frame or the selection from the image, depending on Editor focus. If copying a selection, this will add it to the brushes.","\n      ","Paste Frame"," / ","Selection ","- Paste the frame from the clipboard, or paste the selection from the clipboard to the image, depending on the current focus of the IDE. When pasting into an image, you should note that this\n        option is designed only for use with clipboard data from external programs. When you cut or copy to the clipboard from an image in the Image Editor, this is added to the brushes in the top right of the editor, and you should select a brush to\n        draw with the cut/copied selection rather than try to paste it into the image. Also note that a number of programs will have issues pasting transparencies from the clipboard into GameMaker Studio 2 image editor due to the format used by the clipboard.","\n      ","Select All ","- Select the full image.","\n      ","Cancel Selection"," - Clear any selection from the image.","\n      ","Invert Selection"," - Invert the current selection.","\n      ","Add Frame"," - Add a new frame to the sprite.","\n      ","Insert Frame"," - Insert a new frame after the one currently showing.","\n      ","Delete Selected Fames"," - Remove the selected frame from the sprite (you can use "," / "," + "," and/or "," + "," to select multiple frames).","\n      ","Import Image(s)"," - Load an image to be used as a frame from disk. Note that you can load multiple frames at once by selecting multiple individual files to import in the explorer window. Once you have selected your file or files you\n        will be shown the following Import window:","\n        ","Here you can choose how the imported image should be added to the current sprite, permitting you to resize the entire draw canvas,\n        crop or pad it, and also set the \"anchor\" position for placing the new image(s).","\n      ","Convert to Frames"," - This option will convert a single image into a number of separate frames. You must first have created a single frame with all the parts of the animation in it (or imported a single strip image) like the one shown\n        below:","\n        ","Since this is a single image and we want to convert it into individual frames, we can use this option which will then open the\n        following window:","\n        ","Here you can set how the single image should be split to create the frames, setting the number of frames, the\n        width and height of the frames and any including any offset values.","\n      ","Import Strip Image"," - This option will open a file explorer and prompt you to look for a single strip image file to be used to create frames from. Once selected an image the Import strip window will open, exactly the same as for\n        the ","Convert To Frames"," option shown above.","\n      ","Export to PNG"," - Selecting this option will export the sprite as a single ","PNG"," image. If the sprite has more than a single image, then a \"strip\" sprite will be created with all the images, one\n        after another, and the save file name will automatically be appended with \"","_stripX","\", where \"","X","\" is the number of frames exported. For example, a five frame sprite will\n        be exported as \"","sprite_name_strip5.png","\".","\n      ","Resize All Frames"," - When you select this option it will open the following window where you can set the way that you want to resize all the animation frames that comprise the sprite:","\n        ","You can choose to either ","Scale ","the image, or to ","Resize"," the canvas.\n        If you choose to scale the image then you simply select the new width and/or height for each frame, whether to scale using the same aspect ratio, and also whether to scale in pixels or percent. Note that when scaling you can enable ","linear interpolation"," on or off, where having it on will cause the pixels to blur or \"smear\" as the image is scaled (in general, for hi resolution art you want this ","on",", but for\n        pixel art you want this ","off",").","\n        "," The option to resize the canvas will not alter the pixels within the image but instead increase or decrease the size of the canvas that the images are being drawn on. You can set where the \"anchor\" for the resize should be using\n        the arrow icons, then set the new size (in pixels or as a percentage) as well as set whether to maintain the aspect ratio of the original frames.
