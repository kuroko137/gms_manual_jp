Packets sent with this function are formatted such that the GameMaker Studio 2 game receiving the data can \"split\" the\n    packets correctly, and the function will return the number of bytes of data sent, or a number less than 0 if the send has failed. It is worth noting that the final size of the data being sent that is returned by this function will also include the\n    GameMaker header information, which is an additional 12 bytes.","\n  "," ","\n  ","\n  ","network_send_packet(socket, buffer, size);","\n  ","\n    ","\n      ","\n        ","Argument","\n        ","Description","\n      ","\n      ","\n        ","socket","\n        ","The id of the socket to use.","\n      ","\n      ","\n        ","buffer","\n        ","The id of the buffer to get the data from.","\n      ","\n      ","\n        ","size","\n        ","The size (in bytes) of the data.","\n      ","\n    ","\n  ","\n  "," ","\n  ","\n  ","Real","\n  "," ","\n  ","\n  ","buff = buffer_load(\"player_save.dat\");"," network_send_packet(sock, buff, buffer_get_size(buff));","\n  ","The above information loads a previously saved buffer data into memory and returns the buffer id to be stored in the variable \"buff\".
