They can be made up of single points, lines, or triangles and can be coloured, have alpha blending and even be given a texture, which means that they can be used\n    to create some very exciting effects in a 2D game! For example, you can create a rectangle using multiple triangle primitives, then texture it with a flag sprite and in the draw event of an instance have that flag \"wave\" in the wind and\n    distort the sprite you used by simply modifying the points that form the primitive.","\n  ","WARNING!
