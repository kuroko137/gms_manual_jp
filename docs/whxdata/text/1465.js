In these cases you would use ","choose()"," to generate a random result. For example, say\n    you want to create an object with a random sprite at the start, then you could use this function to set the sprite index to one of a set of given sprites. Note that you can have as many as you require (note that more arguments will mean that the function\n    will be slower to parse).","\n  ","NOTE",": This function will return the same value every time the game is run afresh due to the fact that GameMaker Studio 2 generates the same initial random seed every time to make debugging code a far easier task.
