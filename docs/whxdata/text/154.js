The 2017 Xbox Live stats system simplifies\n    the whole procedure for making achievements and leaderboards, permitting you to create and use the different systems from within GameMaker Studio 2 . The main difference between the 2017 system and previous systems\n    is that you no longer have to define all of the stats you use in game on XDP, and you do not need to tie achievement unlocking to a stat event/rule either (as they are unlocked by a direct function call instead).","\n  ","NOTE",": Although there is no manifest file required with this system, you can still set up some stats on XDP/MDC. Ones setup there will be considered ","featured stats"," which means you can have global leaderboards and\n    the stats turn up on the games dashboard page. For more information, please see the MS article ","Configuring Featured Stats or Leaderboards on Universal Dev Center with Data Platform 2017",".","\n  ","Before calling any of the stats functions listed below, you must make sure that the user is logged in (see the User functions listed above) then setup the stats system and add the user to it using these functions:","\n  "," ","\n  ","\n    ","xboxlive_stats_setup","\n    ","xboxlive_stats_add_user","\n  ","\n  "," ","\n  ","The rest of the 2017 stat functions are as follows:","\n  "," ","\n  ","\n    ","xboxlive_stats_remove_user","\n    ","xboxlive_stats_flush_user","\n    ","xboxlive_stats_set_stat_real","\n    ","xboxlive_stats_set_stat_int","\n    ","xboxlive_stats_set_stat_string","\n    ","xboxlive_stats_delete_stat","\n    ","xboxlive_stats_get_stat_names","\n    ","xboxlive_stats_get_stat","\n    ","xboxlive_stats_get_leaderboard","\n    ","xboxlive_stats_get_social_leaderboard","\n    ","xboxlive_achievements_set_progress","\n    ","xboxlive_get_stats_for_user","\n    ","xboxlive_read_player_leaderboard","\n    ","xboxlive_fire_event","\n  ","\n  "," ","\n  "," ","\n  "," ","\n  ","\n    ","\n      ","\n        ","Back: ","UWP And XBox Live","\n        ","Next: ","Match Making","\n      ","\n    ","\n    ","\n  ","\n  ","\n  ","\n\n"],"4":["Stats And Leaderboards"],"5":["© Copyright YoYo Games Ltd. 2020 All Rights Reserved"],"id":"154"})
