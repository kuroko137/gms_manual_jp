The function returns the unique ID value for the element, which can then be used in further layer functions for sprites.","\n  "," ","\n  ","\n  ","layer_sprite_create(layer_id, x, y, sprite)","\n  ","\n    ","\n      ","\n        ","Argument","\n        ","Description","\n      ","\n      ","\n        ","layer_id","\n        ","The unique ID value of the layer to target","\n      ","\n      ","\n        ","x","\n        ","The x position to use","\n      ","\n      ","\n        ","y","\n        ","The y position to use","\n      ","\n      ","\n        ","sprite","\n        ","The sprite index to be used","\n      ","\n    ","\n  ","\n  "," ","\n  ","\n  ","Sprite element ID (Real)","\n  "," ","\n  ","\n  ","global.asset_layer = layer_create(10000);"," for (var i = 0; i< 10; i++;)","     {\n    ","     var _x = random(room_width);","     var _y = room_height - 100;","     global.asset_spr_trees[i] = layer_sprite_create(global.asset_layer, _x, _y, spr_Trees);","     }\n  ","\n  ","The above code creates a new layer and then adds 10 new sprite elements to it, storing the ID of each element to an array.","\n  "," ","\n  "," ","\n  "," ","\n  ","\n    ","\n      ","\n        ","Back: ","Sprite Layers","\n        ","Next: ","layer_sprite_destroy","\n      ","\n    ","\n    ","\n  ","\n  ","\n  ","\n\n"],"4":["layer_sprite_create"],"5":["© Copyright YoYo Games Ltd. 2020 All Rights Reserved"],"7":["Syntax:","Returns:","Example:"],"id":"712"})
