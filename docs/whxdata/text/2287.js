The exceptions to this are the ","Set"," actions, which can be added to any event and will affect all drawing for all instances afterwards.","\n  ","It is important to note that if you add any actions into the main ","Draw Event"," of an object, then it will ","not"," draw the sprite that has been assigned to the instance unless you explicitly tell GameMaker Studio 2 to draw it, using an action\n    like ","Draw Self",".
