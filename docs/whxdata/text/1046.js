Also, be very careful when using this as it can greatly increase the number of particles on-screen at a time and cause your games to\n    slow down noticeably.","\n  "," ","\n  ","\n  ","part_type_step(ind, step_number, step_type);","\n  ","\n    ","\n      ","\n        ","Argument","\n        ","Description","\n      ","\n      ","\n        ","ind","\n        ","The index of the particle type to change.","\n      ","\n      ","\n        ","step_number","\n        ","The quantity of the new particle to create per step.","\n      ","\n      ","\n        ","step_type","\n        ","The index of the particle type to create.","\n      ","\n    ","\n  ","\n  "," ","\n  ","\n  ","N/A","\n  "," ","\n  ","\n  ","particle2 = part_type_create();"," part_type_shape(particle2, pt_shape_smoke);"," part_type_size(particle2, 0.01, 0.01, 0.01, 0);"," part_type_scale(particle2, 1, 1);"," part_type_colour3(particle2, 4227327, 8454143, 4227327);"," part_type_alpha3(particle2,1,\n    0.50, 0.80);"," part_type_speed(particle2, 0, 0, 0, 0);"," part_type_direction(particle2, 0, 359, 0, 0);"," part_type_gravity(particle2, 0, 270);"," part_type_orientation(particle2, 0, 0, -2, 0, 1);"," part_type_blend(particle2, 1);","    part_type_life(particle2, 160, 160);"," particle3 = part_type_create();"," part_type_shape(particle3, pt_shape_flare);"," part_type_size(particle3, 0.20, 0.20, 0.02, 0);"," part_type_scale(particle3, 1, 1);"," part_type_colour3(particle3,\n    16777215, 8454143, 16777215);"," part_type_alpha3(particle3, 0, 0.50, 0);"," part_type_speed(particle3, 3, 3, -0.03, 0);"," part_type_direction(particle3, 0, 359, 0, 0);"," part_type_gravity(particle3, 0, 270);"," part_type_orientation(particle3,\n    0, 0, 0, 0, 1);"," part_type_blend(particle3, 1);"," part_type_life(particle3, 40, 80);"," part_type_step(particle2, 2, particle3);","\n  ","The above code creates and defines two particles and sets the particle indexed in the variable \"particle2\" to create 2 particles of \"particle3\" every step of its lifetime.","\n  "," ","\n  "," ","\n  "," ","\n  ","\n    ","\n      ","\n        ","Back: ","Particle Types","\n        ","Next: ","part_type_death","\n      ","\n    ","\n    ","\n  ","\n  ","\n  ","\n\n"],"4":["part_type_step"],"5":["© Copyright YoYo Games Ltd. 2020 All Rights Reserved"],"7":["Syntax:","Returns:","Example:"],"id":"1046"})
