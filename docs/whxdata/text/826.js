Also note that when an instance is ","default"," drawing (ie: it has a sprite but no Draw Event), then the\n    ","image_alpha"," variable will be clamped to the alpha set with ","draw_set_alpha()",", such that an ","image_alpha"," of 1 and a draw alpha of 0.5 will draw the sprite at alpha 0.5, while an ","image_alpha"," of 0.25 and a draw alpha\n    of 0.5 will draw the sprite at 0.25 alpha.","\n  "," ","\n  ","\n  ","draw_set_alpha(alpha);","\n  ","\n    ","\n      ","\n        ","Argument","\n        ","Description","\n      ","\n      ","\n        ","alpha","\n        ","The alpha to set (between 0 and 1)","\n      ","\n    ","\n  ","\n  "," ","\n  ","\n  ","N/A","\n  "," ","\n  ","\n  ","draw_set_alpha(0.5);"," draw_set_colour(c_black);\n    "," draw_text(x+5, y+5, \"LEVEL 1\");"," draw_set_alpha(1);\n    "," draw_set_colour(c_white);\n    "," draw_text(x, y, \"LEVEL 1\");","\n  ","The above code will draw some text at the specified position with a shadow effect created by modified draw alpha and colour.","\n  "," ","\n  "," ","\n  "," ","\n  ","\n    ","\n      ","\n        ","Back: ","Colour And Alpha","\n        ","Next: ","draw_set_colour","\n      ","\n    ","\n    ","\n  ","\n  ","\n  ","\n\n"],"4":["draw_set_alpha"],"5":["© Copyright YoYo Games Ltd. 2020 All Rights Reserved"],"7":["Syntax:","Returns:","Example:"],"id":"826"})
