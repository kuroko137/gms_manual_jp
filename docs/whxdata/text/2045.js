Basically, an SCM solution is an independent software package\n    which controls all the aspects of maintaining, changing and comparing versions of your project as you work on it. This is especially useful to those that work in a team and need to be able to control who does what and not worry about losing data or\n    making changes that may need to be undone at a later date, but individuals can benefit from this powerful yet flexible system too.","\n  ","There are various SCM tools available to you, and GameMaker Studio 2 comes with a Git plugin included which can be used straight away, and you have no need to install any extra packages as it is all bundled with the plugin itself.
