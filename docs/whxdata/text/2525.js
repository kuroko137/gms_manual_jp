You can choose the type of number to generate (either a decimal or an integer) and then set the range for the number to be generated within by supplying\n    a minimum and maximum value. The random value generated will be returned to the target variable (which can be flagged as a temporary local variable).","\n  ","NOTE",": When generating a random integer the action will return an integer value between the minimum and maximum value ","inclusive",", so a range of 5 - 10 could return 5 or 10 as well as any integer in between. However generating a random decimal\n    will not ever return the maximum value so the range 5 to 10 can return 5 but will not return 10 (although it could return 9.999999999999).","\n  "," ","\n  ","\n  ","\n  ","\n  ","\n    ","\n      ","\n        ","Argument","\n        ","Description","\n      ","\n      ","\n        ","Type","\n        ","The type of numbers to use (integer or decimal)","\n      ","\n      ","\n        ","Minimum","\n        ","The minimum number for the random range","\n      ","\n      ","\n        ","Maximum","\n        ","The maximum number for the random range","\n      ","\n      ","\n        ","Target","\n        ","The target variable to store the returned value","\n      ","\n    ","\n  ","\n  "," ","\n  ","\n  ","The above action block code generates a random value and assigns it to a temporary\n    local variable.
