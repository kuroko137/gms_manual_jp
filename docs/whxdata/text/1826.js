It is also commonly used to check the integrity of files and strings.\n    This function will take an input unicode string (which is 16bits for each char) and return the 32-character hexadecimal MD5 hash that is unique to that string. In this way you can generate a secure key which can be stored and used to check the integrity\n    of the information being sent to (or received from) an external server (for example).","\n  ","NOTE: ","There are two formats for the MD5 encoding, UTF-8 and unicode. Both are provided to facilitate communication with different server setups, but the most common to use is unicode.","\n  "," ","\n  ","\n  ","md5_string_unicode(string)","\n  ","\n    ","\n      ","\n        ","Argument","\n        ","Description","\n      ","\n      ","\n        ","string","\n        ","The string to hash.","\n      ","\n    ","\n  ","\n  "," ","\n  ","\n  ","String","\n  "," ","\n  ","\n  ","var hash, str;"," str = base64_encode(game_data);"," hash = md5_string_unicode(str);"," http_get(\"http://www.MacSweeneyGames.com/CatchTheHaggis/gamedata?hash=\" + hash); http_get(\"http://www.MacSweeneyGames.com/CatchTheHaggis/gamedata?data=\"\n    + str);","\n  ","The above code will base64 encode a string and then generate an MD5 hash.
