The buffer should be no more than 256 bytes in size - anything beyond that will be chopped off - and can contain any data you require. The score\n    to be uploaded should be a real number, and the leaderboard name is a string that was defined when you created the leaderboard using the function ","steam_create_leaderboard()",".","\n  ","If the function fails, it will return a value of -1, while a successful post will return a unique ID for the upload and trigger an asynchronous ","Steam Event",".

This data buffer will be ","Base 64 encoded"," and so you will need to use\n    the function ","buffer_base64_decode()"," on the data before reading from the buffer.","\n  "," ","\n  ","\n  ","steam_upload_score_buffer(lb_name, score, buffer);","\n  ","\n    ","\n      ","\n        ","Argument","\n        ","Description","\n      ","\n      ","\n        ","lb_name","\n        ","The name of the leaderboard that you are uploading the scores to (a string).","\n      ","\n      ","\n        ","score","\n        ","The score to upload (a real number).","\n      ","\n      ","\n        ","buffer","\n        ","The ID of the buffer to attach.","\n      ","\n    ","\n  ","\n  "," ","\n  ","\n  ","Real","\n  "," ","\n  ","\n  ","In this example, we first upload a score and then parse the ","async_load"," map returned if successful.

This would be used to try the upload again at a later time and you can add extra code there to retry the upload or to save the score to a text file should it continue to fail, etc... Also note that we\n    immediately delete the buffer, since it is no longer required for the function.
