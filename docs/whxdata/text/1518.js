Next you must specify the direction you look ","at"," and this is done by giving a second point to look towards\n    with the arguments (xto, yto, zto). Finally, you can still rotate the camera around the line from the viewpoint to the looking point, and to specify this we must give an \"up\" vector - the direction that is upwards in the camera.
