You give the background element ID (which you get when you create a background element using ","layer_background_create()"," or when\n    you use the function ","layer_background_get_id()","), and then set the alpha value to use. Alpha can be between 0 (fully transparent) and 1 (fully opaque) with the default alpha value for the background\n    element being 1. Note that if the layer the background element has been assigned to is not visible - or the element itself has been made invisible - you will not see any difference with this function until the layer or element has been made visible\n    again.","\n  "," ","\n  ","\n  ","layer_background_alpha(background_element_id, alpha);","\n  ","\n    ","\n      ","\n        ","Argument","\n        ","Description","\n      ","\n      ","\n        ","background_element_id","\n        ","The unique ID value of the background element to change","\n      ","\n      ","\n        ","alpha","\n        ","The alpha for background sprite, from 0 to 1 (default is 1)","\n      ","\n    ","\n  ","\n  "," ","\n  ","\n  ","N/A","\n  "," ","\n  ","\n  ","var lay_id = layer_get_id(\"Background_sky\");"," var back_id = layer_background_get_id(lay_id);"," layer_background_alpha(back_id, random(1));","\n  ","The above code gets the ID value of the background assigned to the layer \"Background_sky\" and then sets its alpha to a random value between 0 and 1.","\n  "," ","\n  "," ","\n  "," ","\n  ","\n    ","\n      ","\n        ","Back: ","Background Layers","\n        ","Next: ","layer_background_index","\n      ","\n    ","\n    ","\n  ","\n  ","\n  ","\n\n"],"4":["layer_background_alpha"],"5":["© Copyright YoYo Games Ltd. 2020 All Rights Reserved"],"7":["Syntax:","Returns:","Example:"],"id":"694"})
