You can also tell it to use precise collision checking when enabled,\n    but be aware that this requires all instances to have precise masks enabled and will greatly slow down your game when many instances are involved due to the amount of processing that has to be done. This should normally go in the step event of an\n    instance, but can be used selectively in a collision event too, as illustrated by the code example below.","\n  "," ","\n  ","\n  ","move_bounce_all( adv );","\n  ","\n    ","\n      ","\n        ","Argument","\n        ","Description","\n      ","\n      ","\n        ","adv","\n        ","Whether to enable advanced bouncing (true) or not (false).","\n      ","\n    ","\n  ","\n  "," ","\n  ","\n  ","N/A","\n  "," ","\n  ","\n  ","if other.visible","     {\n    ","     move_bounce_all(false);\n    ","     }\n  ","\n  ","The above code would be placed in a collision event with another object.
