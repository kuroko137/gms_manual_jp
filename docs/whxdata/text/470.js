These values can get then be recovered in the shader to work out which vertex you are dealing with (ie: which corner).","\n  "," ","\n  ","\n  ","shader_enable_corner_id(enable);","\n  ","\n    ","\n      ","\n        ","Argument","\n        ","Description","\n      ","\n      ","\n        ","enable","\n        ","Enable (","true",") or disable (","false",") this function.","\n      ","\n    ","\n  ","\n  "," ","\n  ","\n  ","N/A","\n  "," ","\n  ","\n  ","shader_enable_corner_id(true);","\n  ","The above code will enable the use of colour bits for the corner id for all shaders.","\n  "," ","\n  "," ","\n  "," ","\n  ","\n    ","\n      ","\n        ","Back: ","Shaders","\n        ","Next: ","shader_get_name","\n      ","\n    ","\n    ","\n  ","\n  ","\n  ","\n\n"],"4":["shader_enable_corner_id"],"5":["© Copyright YoYo Games Ltd. 2020 All Rights Reserved"],"7":["Syntax:","Returns:","Example:"],"id":"470"})
