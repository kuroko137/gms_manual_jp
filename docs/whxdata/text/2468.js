You select the sound from the asset explorer and then set the volume value. The volume can be between 0 (silent) and 1 (full volume) and the scale is linear, such that a value of 0.5 would be\n    half volume. Note that this action will affect all instances of the sound that are playing currently in the room, and will affect all future instances of the sound played.","\n  "," ","\n  ","\n  ","\n  ","\n  ","\n    ","\n      ","\n        ","Argument","\n        ","Description","\n      ","\n      ","\n        ","Sound","\n        ","The sound resource to set the volume of","\n      ","\n      ","\n        ","Volume","\n        ","The new volume for the sound (from 0 to 1, default 1)","\n      ","\n    ","\n  ","\n  "," ","\n  ","\n  ","The above action block code checks a global variable to see if it is ","true","    or false.
