You give the name of the variable and then the value, which can be added ","relative"," to the original value if\n    required. If you give a new variable name (ie: a variable that has never been assigned previously in the instance) then this will create the new variable and assign it the value you give, while if you give the name of an existing variable, it will\n    simply change the value to the new one. Note that checking ","Is Relative"," will add the value to the existing variable value (use a negative number to subtract) and you can also use ","expression","    ","s"," and variables created previously as the value.","\n  ","It is worth noting that when we talk about \"values\", we don't just mean numeric values, as a variable can be a string, a pointer, a resource ID or anything else that a function can return or use. In the case of a string, checking ","Relative"," will\n    concatenate the value with whatever the variable previously held, so if your variable was \"Hello\" and you assign \" World\" to it using the relative check, the final variable value will be \"Hello World\". Care must be taken,\n    however, to ensure that the variable values are both of the same ","data type",", as trying to add, for example, an integer and a string, will result in a compiler error.","\n  ","Note that you can add additional variables in the same action by clicking the plus icon "," beside the action, and giving another variable name and\n    value.
