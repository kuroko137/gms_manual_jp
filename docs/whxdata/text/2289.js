In a number of situations you want to let your instances complete an action depending on a particular value, and while you can do this using a number of consecutive \"if\" statements, this\n    can get messy when the possible choices gets above two or three. In these cases it is better to use the \"switch\" action. A switch action works as follows:","\n  ","\n    ","You supply value a (usually from some kind of expression or variable)","\n    ","The value is compared with the value assigned to the various \"case\" statements","\n    ","If the value is the same as the case value, the contents of the case are performed otherwise the next case is evaluated, etc...","\n    ","Once a case has been performed ","or"," all cases have been evaluated and failed, the code will continue from the end of the switch","\n    ","If all cases failed and you have a default case, then that will be performed before the code continues from the end of the switch","\n  ","\n  ","The ","Switches"," library has the following actions:","\n  ","\n    ","\n  ","\n    ","\n      ","\n        ","\n        ","Switch","\n      ","\n      ","\n        ","\n        ","Case","\n      ","\n      ","\n        ","\n        ","Default","\n      ","\n    ","\n  ","\n  "," ","\n  "," ","\n  "," ","\n  "," ","\n  "," ","\n  "," ","\n  "," ","\n  "," ","\n  ","\n    ","\n      ","\n        ","Back: ","Index","\n        ","Next: ","Data Structure Actions","\n      ","\n    ","\n    ","\n  ","\n  ","\n  ","\n\n"],"4":["Switch Action Library"],"5":["© Copyright YoYo Games Ltd. 2020 All Rights Reserved"],"id":"2289"})
