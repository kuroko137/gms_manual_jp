The following\n    is a general guide to show which values are most appropriate for each data type (when in doubt, use an alignment of 1):","\n  ","\n    ","Strings should be aligned to 1 byte.","\n    ","Signed or unsigned 8bit integers can be aligned to any value, but note that for a fast buffer (see ","buffer_write()",") it ","must"," be aligned to 1.","\n    ","Signed or unsigned 16bit integers should be aligned to 2 bytes.","\n    ","Signed or unsigned 32bit integers should be aligned to 4 bytes","\n    ","Floats of up to 16bits should be aligned to 2 bytes.

The start vertex can be anywhere between 0 and the number of vertices -1, and then you give the number of vertices from that point\n    to copy. You can use the function ","vertex_get_number()"," on the vertex buffer to get the total number of vertices stored.","\n  ","NOTE",": It's important that you remove any dynamically created resources like this from memory when you no longer need them to prevent memory leaks, so when you are finished with the buffer that you have created you should free it up again\n    using ","buffer_delete()",". Also note that the vertex buffer used to create the new buffer is not removed from memory either and you should use the function\n    ","vertex_delete_buffer()"," when it is no longer required.","\n  "," ","\n  ","\n  ","buffer_create_from_vertex_buffer_ext(vertex_buffer, type, alignment, start_vertex, num_vertices)","\n  ","\n    ","\n      ","\n        ","Argument","\n        ","Description","\n      ","\n      ","\n        ","vertex_buffer","\n        ","The vertex buffer index to use.","\n      ","\n      ","\n        ","type","\n        ","The type of buffer to create (see the constants list below).","\n      ","\n      ","\n        ","alignment","\n        ","The byte alignment for the buffer","\n      ","\n      ","\n        ","start_vertex","\n        ","The starting vertex.","\n      ","\n      ","\n        ","num_vertices","\n        ","The total number of vertices to copy.","\n      ","\n    ","\n  ","\n  "," ","\n  ","\n  ","Int (Vertex buffer ID)","\n  "," ","\n  ","\n  ","var v_num = vertex_get_number(model_buff); player_buffer = buffer_create_from_vertex_buffer(model_buffer, buffer_grow, 1, 0, v_num - 1);","\n  ","The above code allocates memory to a buffer then copies the data of all vertices from the given vertex buffer into it, returning the index of the new buffer which is stored in the variable \"player_buffer\", for future use.","\n  "," ","\n  "," ","\n  "," ","\n  ","\n    ","\n      ","\n        ","Back: ","Buffers","\n        ","Next: ","buffer_delete","\n      ","\n    ","\n    ","\n  ","\n  ","\n  ","\n\n"],"4":["buffer_create_from_vertex_buffer_ext"],"5":["© Copyright YoYo Games Ltd. 2020 All Rights Reserved"],"7":["Syntax:","Returns:","Example:"],"id":"1835"})
