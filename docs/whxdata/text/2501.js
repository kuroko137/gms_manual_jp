You supply the variable that holds the stack index (as returned by the action ","Create Stack",") and then give the value to push onto the top. With stack data\n    structures, values are always added onto the \"top\" of the stack, and never at the end or in the middle (if you require this functionality, then use a list data structure).","\n  "," ","\n  ","\n  ","\n  ","\n  ","\n    ","\n      ","\n        ","Argument","\n        ","Description","\n      ","\n      ","\n        ","Stack","\n        ","The index (stored in a variable) of the stack to use","\n      ","\n      ","\n        ","Value","\n        ","The value to push onto the stack","\n      ","\n    ","\n  ","\n  "," ","\n  ","\n  ","The above action block code creates an instance variable and a new stack data structure.\n    The index of the stack is stored in the new variable, and then a loop is performed which creates 10 instances and pushes their unique ID values onto the stack.","\n  "," ","\n  "," ","\n  "," ","\n  ","\n    ","\n      ","\n        ","Back: ","Data Structure Actions","\n        ","Next: ","Pop Stack","\n      ","\n    ","\n    ","\n  ","\n  ","\n  ","\n\n"],"4":[" Push Onto Stack"],"5":["© Copyright YoYo Games Ltd. 2020 All Rights Reserved"],"7":["Action Syntax:","Arguments:","Example:"],"id":"2501"})
