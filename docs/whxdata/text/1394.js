Keep in mind that for legacy support strings are indexed from 1, so 1 is the first position in the string, not 0 as you may expect.","\n  "," ","\n  ","\n  ","string_pos_ext(substr, str, start_pos);","\n  ","\n    ","\n      ","\n        ","Argument","\n        ","Description","\n      ","\n      ","\n        ","substr","\n        ","The substring to look for in the string.","\n      ","\n      ","\n        ","str","\n        ","The string.","\n      ","\n      ","\n        ","start_pos","\n        ","The starting position to search from.","\n      ","\n    ","\n  ","\n  "," ","\n  ","\n  ","Integer","\n  "," ","\n  ","\n  ","if (string_pos_ext(\",\", text, 20) != 0)","    {\n    ","    string_insert(name, text, string_pos_ext(\",\", text, 20));","    }\n  ","\n  ","The above code searches the string stored in the variable \"text\" for a comma after the 20th character, and if it finds one it inserts the substring \"name\" at that position.","\n  "," ","\n  "," ","\n  "," ","\n  ","\n    ","\n      ","\n        ","Back: ","Strings","\n        ","Next: ","string_last_pos","\n      ","\n    ","\n    ","\n  ","\n  ","\n  ","\n\n"],"4":["string_pos_ext"],"5":["© Copyright YoYo Games Ltd. 2020 All Rights Reserved"],"7":["Syntax:","Returns:","Example:"],"id":"1394"})
