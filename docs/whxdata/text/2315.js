To start with this list will be blank, but as you open different windows in the IDE (like a sprite or a script or an object, etc...) the list will be populated.

The RMB menu also has an additional option permitting you to clear the list completely. It's worth noting that the\n    Recent Windows list can be docked to the sides of the IDE and you can also adjust certain ","Preferences"," to change how it behaves.","\n  "," ","\n  "," ","\n  "," ","\n  ","\n    ","\n      ","\n        ","Back: ","IDE Input And Navigation","\n        ","Next: ","Menus","\n      ","\n    ","\n    ","\n  ","\n  ","\n  ","\n\n"],"4":["Recent Windows"],"5":["© Copyright YoYo Games Ltd. 2020 All Rights Reserved"],"id":"2315"})
