It is a value that can be added on to the speed of objects so that they will eventually move at the same\n    speed, regardless of lag. This is achieved in GameMaker Studio 2 by using the ","read only"," variable ","delta_time"," every step as it measures the time that has passed between one step and the next in microseconds (1microsecond is 1,000,000th\n    of a second). Therefore the variable ","delta_time"," can be used to calculate how much faster (for example) a game character has to move to make up for a lag spike in the game.","\n  "," ","\n  ","\n  ","delta_time","\n  "," ","\n  ","\n  ","Real (integer)","\n  "," ","\n  ","\n  ","var _dt = delta_time / 1000000;"," speed = spd * dt;","\n  ","The above code will set the speed of the instance using delta-time to correct for lag. The variable \"_dt\" would be used to hold the previously calculated delta time value so that the ratio can be used to multiply the base speed value (held\n    in the variable \"spd\") and so get a consistent speed for the instance.","\n  "," ","\n  "," ","\n  "," ","\n  ","\n    ","\n      ","\n        ","Back: ","Date And TIme","\n        ","Next: ","date_set_timezone","\n      ","\n    ","\n    ","\n  ","\n  ","\n  ","\n\n"],"4":["delta_time"],"5":["© Copyright YoYo Games Ltd. 2020 All Rights Reserved"],"7":["Syntax:","Returns:","Example:"],"id":"1458"})
