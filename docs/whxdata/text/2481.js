The data structure will still exist, only you will have no way to reference it, so either use an instance variable and free the structure at a later time, or free the structure before the end of\n    the event or function if its index is stored in a temporary variable.","\n  "," ","\n  ","\n  ","\n  ","\n  ","\n    ","\n      ","\n        ","Argument","\n        ","Description","\n      ","\n      ","\n        ","Target","\n        ","The target variable to store the map index in","\n      ","\n    ","\n  ","\n  "," ","\n  ","\n  ","The above action block code creates a new instance variable and a new map data structure.
