You supply the DS map ID value (as returned by the function ","ds_map_create()","), then give the key you want to set and the value to set it\n    to. Keys can be integers or strings, and if the given key does not exist then it will be created for you and set to the value. This function is the same as using the ","DS map accessor"," to set/create a\n    map key/value pair.
