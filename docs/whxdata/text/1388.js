Both can be very handy, some games prefer to display a score as a set number\n    of digits, while control over decimal places can be good for a high accuracy the two decimal places of ","string()"," cannot provide. If the number of places specified is greater than the value to be shown and/or the number\n    plus the decimal places that have been specified is less than the total places, then spaces will be added before the value to make up the difference (see the example below). Zeros will be added to the right of the decimal point if the value given\n    is less than the total and the number of decimal places to include. The default format is no extra spaces on the left, and only two decimal places on the right, eg \"265.73\".","\n  "," ","\n  ","\n  ","string_format(val, tot, dec);","\n  ","\n    ","\n      ","\n        ","Argument","\n        ","Description","\n      ","\n      ","\n        ","val","\n        ","The real number to be turned into a string.","\n      ","\n      ","\n        ","tot","\n        ","The total number of places of the main number to be shown.
