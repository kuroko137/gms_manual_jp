There are two types of curves that can be used for parameter tracks:","\n  ","\n    ","Embedded Curves",": These are curves that are embedded in the sequence and are unique to the parameter track they are used on.","\n    ","Animation Curves",": These are curves that are created independently of the sequence using the ","Animation Curve Editor",".","\n  ","\n  ","We'll start by explaining how to use an Animation Curve asset, which is simply a case of creating a new curve, setting up the channels in the Animation Curve Editor, and then dragging the curve asset into the dope sheet to apply it to the parameter\n    track:","\n  ","\n    ","\n  ","You can also use the right mouse button "," menu option ","Set To External Anim Curve ","to add an animation curve asset to the selected parameter\n    track. This will open the Asset Explorer where you can select the required curve from the ones presented to you:","\n  ","It is important to note that the Animation Curve asset ","must have the correct number of channels for the track it is being applied to",",\n    as each type of parameter track will require a different number of channels in the animation curve, with a different range per-channel. Below is a list of the different parameter tracks and the channels that they will require in each curve asset (channels\n    should be added in the order given for each parameter type):","\n  ","\n    ","Position",": 2 channels, X and Y.","\n    ","Rotation",": 1 channel.","\n    ","Colour Multiply",": 4 channels, Alpha, Red, Green and Blue, and the range ","must"," be between 0 and 255.","\n    ","Image Index",": 1 channel.","\n    ","Image Speed",": 1 channel.","\n    ","Origin",": 2 channels, X and Y.","\n    ","Scale",": 2 channels, X scale and Y scale, and note that the value is a multiplier, so the base value is 1 (no scale) and greater than one will make the image bugger, and less than 1 will make it smaller. Negative values will flip or\n      mirror the image as well as apply scale.","\n    ","Pitch",": 1 channel, which ","must"," be scaled from 0 and 1 is the default pitch of the sound.","\n    ","Volume",": 1 channel, which ","must ","be scaled from 0 and have a maximum of 1.","\n  ","\n  ","By default, the animation curve will be applied along the entire length of the asset key it is attached to, however, much like with keyframes, you can click "," on a curve and drag it to re-position it on the timeline, and you can also hold down the "," key and and drag to resize the length of the curve\n    (this also applies to ","embedded curves","):","\n  ","The other way to add a parameter curve to a track is to embed it. This can be done by either clicking the right mouse button\n    "," on the parameter track and selecting \"","Convert to embedded anim curve","\", or by clicking on the ","Toggle Curve Mode"," "," button, which will show you the track as an animation curve in the full dope sheet area, and you can then click the ","Convert To Curve"," button:","\n  ","Once you have converted the parameter keyframe track to a curve it can be edited within the dope sheet, exactly the same way\n    that you can edit ","animation curve assets",", this includes adding or removing points, changing their position, changing the curve type (linear, smooth or bezier), and renaming channels and the colour associated with\n    it.","\n  ","IMPORTANT",": You can also edit animation curve assets that have been applied to parameter tracks in this way, however any changes you make ","will be applied to all tracks that use the animation curve",", as you are editing\n    the curve asset and not a single copy of it. To edit an animation curve asset that has been applied to a track ","only"," on that track, you must first use the right mouse menu "," on the parameter track and select ","Convert To Embedded Anim Curve",". This will duplicate the animation curve asset and embed it in the pararmeter track as an independent curve only for that track. Conversely, you can convert\n    an embedded animation curve into an Animation Curve asset using the right mouse button "," menu option ","Export Embedded Anim Curve",".\n    This will convert the embedded curve into a new asset which can then be edited as normal as well as applied to other parameter tracks if required.","\n  ","\n  ","The image above shows how the embedded animation curve editor looks, and it's very similar that used by the Animation Curve Editor. Expand each section below for more information on the different sections.","\n  "," ","\n  ","Curve Name","Curve Name","\n  ","\n    ","This will be the name of the external animation curve asset or the name of the parameter track for an embedded curve.

Each channel must have a unique name (using alpha numeric characters and the \"_\" under-bar symbol only), and you can also set the colour for\n      the channel by double clicking "," on the colour swatch to the left, which will open the colour picker to let you choose a new colour. To rename the channel, you can do\n      a slow double click "," and rename, and you can also use the right mouse button "," to open\n      a menu where you can choose to rename, change the colour or copy the channel. Channels can be expanded by clicking the arrow beside the name to show each of the points on the channel curve, and these points can be edited manually by clicking the\n      current value and typing in the new value. You can also toggle the channel visibility in the dope sheet by clicking on the \"eye\" icon ",".","\n    "," ","\n  ","\n  ","Conversion Control","Conversion Control","\n  ","\n    ","Here keyframes can be converted into parameter curves (as explained fiurther up this page) but there is also a button to convert parameter curves into keyframes. However, you should be aware that when doing this there are a couple of caveats. Keyframes\n      cannot be \"between\" frames, and so some curve values will need to be rounded to the nearest frame, which in turn will change the way the parameter track behaves. Also, if the parameter curve uses catmull-rom or bezier interpolation, ","this will be lost ","and\n      the interpolation between keyframes will be set to linear interpolation.","\n    "," ","\n  ","\n  ","Curve Menu","Curve Menu","\n  ","\n    ","This menu contains options available elsewhere in the editor, but all in one place.
