A basic game in GameMaker Studio 2 will require a room to run in (new projects will always be created with\n    a room asset already created), and usually at least one object and a sprite, although you'll likely use a lot more!","\n  ","\n  ","The Asset Browser is where you'll create and organise the assets for your game as well as modify certain other aspects like platform specific settings and configurations.

All projects require at least one room to run and the room at the top of the list is the \"home\" room and will be the first room entered when the\n        game initially starts (it is flagged with a \"home\" icon ","). To quickly change room order, simply click "," and drag the room up or down the list and then release the mouse button to place it at the new position.

By default - when you create a new project - this will be populated with numerous folder groups labelled with the different kinds of assets that can\n      be added, but these can be renamed or even removed and you don't have to store assets of the same kind in each group. For example, you may find it more useful to ceate a group of assets for each level of your game rather than for each kind of\n      asset, so you can create folder groups called \"Level 1\", \"Level 2\", etc... and store all the different assets for each level in the same folder. How you organise things really is up to you!","\n    "," To add a new asset to the list you can use the ","Add Asset"," button at the top of the Asset Browser, or you can open\n      the right mouse button "," menu anywhere in the asset list and then select the resource to create:","\n    "," Once the asset has been created it will be opened in the workspace and you can rename it to something that is appropriate to your\n      game, but note that asset names can only be alpha-numeric, cannot start with a number, and can only use the underscore \"_\" as an additional character. You can also use the right button menu to create new folder groups to contain assets\n      using the ","Create Group"," option, and these can be named anything you wish. If you want to rename any asset or folder group, then you can do a slow double-click "," on them or use the RMB "," menu option ","Rename",".","\n    ","An important feature of the asset browser is the ability to colour assets so they are more immediately recognisable within the list.

If you wish to reset this to the default 100%, then simply double-click\n      "," on the percentage value to the left of the slider. Note that there are a couple of preferences available to deal with how this works in the ","Asset Browser Preferences",".","\n  ","\n  "," ","\n  "," ","\n  ","\n  ","As mentioned in various of the sections above, the asset browser gives you the ability to add tags to individual assets as well as to group folders. Tags are a very powerful tool, not only for organising and filtering the assets listed in the asset\n    browser, but also when programming your game in general, as you can use assigned tags in code.","\n  ","To create a tag you need to use the RMB "," menu on either a folder group or an asset and then select the ","Edit Tag"," option. This will bring up the ","Tag Editor","    where you can type in the tag you want to use, and then press  to apply it:","\n  ","You can assign multiple tags to a single item, and you can also use "," or "," / "," along with the left\n    mouse button "," to select multiple assets and assign a tag to all of them at once. You can also add a tag to a folder group, which will apply it to all the assets within the\n    folder. Once added, all tags will be visible under the Quick Access menu and also in the Filter options (as explained in the sections above), and so can be used to quickly filter the asset list and show only those items with the chosen tag or tags.","\n  ","It is important to note that assets that are created while tags are part of the active filter ","will be given those tags automatically",". This means that if you are viewing all assets under the \"Level 1\" tag - for example - all\n    new assets created with this filter active will also have the \"Level 1\" tag added to them upon creation.","\n  ","Finally, tags can also be used in your project code to identify any asset and then act on it, making it a very powerful tool as you can code behaviours based on a tag or group of tags. For example, imagine you have a project with a \" ","Die On Touch","\"\n    tag. When programming the project, you can check this tag and code functionality that is appropriate, then later the artists and level designers can create new assets of any type and tag them with the \" ","Die On Touch","\"\n    tag then use the asset when designing a level. Any code that has been programmed already to use this tag will automatically include these new assets.","\n  ","For more information on using tags in the project code, please see the section on ","Assets And Tags",".","\n  "," ","\n  "," ","\n  ","\n  ","When working with the Asset Browser, you can use the right mouse button "," on any resource or folder to open a menu of options:","\n  ","The exact options available to you will depend on the context that has been clicked, and below we show the contents when the menu is opened on an asset\n    or folder group in the Asset List (other contexts will show some of these but not all):","\n  ","\n    ","Create ","- Create a new asset. On selecting this you will be presented with a list of the available asset types that can be created for you to select one. Note that if you open this menu on a specific asset, there will be an additional\n      option to create a resource if the same type listed just below so you don't have to look for the asset type in the list.","\n    ","Edit (All) ","- Open the resource properties editor for the selected asset(s) or folder group (note that you can double click "," on a single\n      asset too to open it for it editing).","\n    ","Edit Tags"," - This will open the Tag editor where you can add or remove tags to the selected asset(s) or folder group(s).","\n    ","Rename ","- Rename the asset or the folder group.","\n    ","Duplicate ","- Create a duplicate of the asset or assets that have been selected.","\n    ","Favourite ","- Flag an asset or assets as being a favourite, adding it to the Quick Access section at the top of the Asset browser.","\n    ","Add Existing"," - Add existing assets from a different GameMaker Studio 2 project folder. Please note that assets created using a version anterior to 2.3.0 will require conversion as the project file format changed with the 2.3.0 update.\n      This means it may be preferable to import the entire project and converting everything then saving it to a new location if the assets are imported frequently into other projects.","\n    ","Add Existing From My Library"," - Add assets to the asset list from an item in your Marketplace library. Please note that Marketplace assets created using a version anterior to 2.3.0 will require conversion as the project file format\n      changed with the 2.3.0 update.","\n    ","Delete ","- Delete the selected asset(s) from the project. This cannot be undone!","\n    ","Create Group"," - Add a new folder group to the asset list.","\n    ","Expand Children"," - Expand the currently selected folder group along with any sub-folders it may contain.","\n    ","Expand All"," - Expand all the folder groups in the asset list.","\n    ","Contract All"," - Contract all the folder groups in the asset list.","\n    ","Open In New Asset Browser"," - This option is only available for folder groups, and it will open the group in a new Asset browser window containing only the contents of the parent group the option was selected for.","\n    ","Open in Explorer"," - This will open the file explorer on the location of the file that has been stored for the resource in your project folder.","\n    ","Colour Swatches"," - Here you can select a new colour for the asset to use.

The values you set can be between -1 and 1 on the vertical axis and the duration along the horizontal axis is always normalised form 0 to 1, making it easy to target different\n      time ranges using multipliers in your game code. Animation curves are comprised of \"channels\" and each channel can have its own curve settings, which permits you to - for example - describe a spacial position with two channels for the\n      x/y position, or a colour gradient with 4 channels to represent a colour format. Animation curve assets can be used when working with sequences and can also be accessed using code, making them a powerful tool when creating your games.","\n    ","You can find out more about adding animation curves from the section on ","Animation Curves",".","\n    "," ","\n  ","\n  "," ","Extensions","Extensions","\n  ","\n    ","\n      ","Extensions are additional files and code that you can add to extend the GameMaker Studio 2 functionality as well as add assets to your game from the ","Marketplace",".

Here you can select a font that you have on your computer and import it into GameMaker Studio 2 for use in your game, setting various attributes like size and weight or style. Once imported and added as a resource, you can then set it for\n      drawing using the appropriate code or actions.","\n    ","NOTE",": If you are adding fonts to your game, make sure you have the licence necessary to re-distribute it, unless it is public domain or copyright free.","\n    ","The RMB "," menu for fonts contains the following option (as well as those listed further up this page):","\n    ","\n      ","Assign Texture Group"," - When you select this option, you will be presented with a list of the available texture groups, and you can then choose one to add the font to or create a new one, if required.

Most of the time they have ","sprites"," associated with them so that you see them in the game\n      room, but sometimes they are used as a \"behind the scenes\" controller to do things related to the user or for timing, etc... They can be given behaviours and they can react to certain events as well as to each other, and most of the things\n      you see in a game are based on objects and their interactions. Note that we say \"based on\" because you don't actually place objects directly into the game room, but rather you place ","instances ","of these objects, which\n      are basically copies (or clones if you prefer) of the object resource. This is a very important thing to remember as instances and objects are not the same thing and each have their own set of functions that can affect them.","\n    ","All objects have a set of properties which you can specify in the object editor, like the sprite, whether it uses ","physics"," or not, or whether it is a \"child\" object of another one.\n      They also have a series of built-in variables that can then be used in actions, scripts and code. These built-in variables are used to define the position of the instance when placed in the game room, the animation speed, the direction of movement\n      and a whole host of other things. To control how the object behaves over time, each game frame is split into a series of events, so you can add code or actions into a specific event and it will only run when the event is triggered, and events can\n      be triggered by things like mouse button presses or collisions with other instances.","\n    ","Objects are in a very real sense the building blocks of your game, and together with rooms will form the core of any project that you create.","\n    ","The RMB "," menu for objects contains the following option (as well as those listed further up this page):","\n    ","\n      ","Open All Event Scripts"," - Selecting this option will open all the assigned events for the object in a new workspace as script tabs.","\n    ","\n    ","You can find out more about adding objects from the section on the ","Object Editor",".","\n    "," ","\n    ","\n  ","\n  "," ","Paths","Paths","\n  ","\n    ","At some point while creating your games you may need an instance of one of your objects to follow a path through a level. Now, this can be done by simply creating an array of positions within the room and then having the instance move between them,\n      but that can be a chore to set up and is difficult to change, test and adapt for different things. That is when you'd want to create a path resource.","\n    ","The basic idea of the path resource is rather simple - you define a path by drawing it in the path editor, then you can place an action (or code) in an event of an object to tell the object to follow that particular path in the game room. You can\n      set the speed to follow the path and a number of other actions relating to the position and orientation of the path within the room too.","\n    ","You can find out more about adding paths from the section on the ","Path Editor",".","\n    "," ","\n  ","\n  "," ","Rooms","Rooms","\n  ","\n    ","All games that you make in GameMaker Studio 2 need at least one room to run (but can have many, many more) , and a room is basically a space where you place instances of the objects that make up your game and where the action of the game will take\n      place. However the Room Editor is one of the most powerful of resources available to you, since it permits you to not only add instances of objects, but to set up the \"view\" into the game room, add the backgrounds and tiles that are drawn\n      to create the game world, create extra special effects that are independent of the object/instance system, and as well as run code independently of an object. Rooms can also be set to ","inherit ","properties from other rooms, meaning\n      that you can create a single room with a load of tiles, for example, and then make another room that inherits these tiles, so that you don't have to re-create them again.","\n    ","The RMB "," menu for rooms contains the following option (as well as those listed further up this page):","\n    ","\n      ","Create Child Room"," - This will create a new room as a child of the room selected.

Now you could add all the required code into each object that requires it, but in general you'd be better off creating a single function in script resource and then calling that. This means that you only have to add one line\n      of code into the objects to call this new scripted function, and if you wish to change something you only need to change it once in the script and all the objects will automatically run the new code, rather than have to go through every object and\n      change the same thing in multiple places.","\n    ","The RMB "," menu for scripts contains the following option (as well as those listed further up this page):","\n    ","\n      ","Convert to DnD™ / GML"," - This will convert the selected script to DnD™ or GML.

The full shader is comprised of a vertex\n      shader program, and a fragment shader program (also known as a pixel shader).

These files are much smaller than a WAV file and but do have a ","CPU overhead"," associated with them as they have to be decoded before being played.","\n    ","The RMB  "," menu for sounds contains the following options (as well as those listed further up this page):","\n    ","\n      ","Open In Sound Mixer"," - This will open all the selected sounds in the ","Sound Mixer",".","\n      ","Assign Audio Group"," - When you select this option, you will be presented with a list of the available audio groups, and you can then choose one to add the sound to or create a new one, if required.

As such, a sprite is an image drawn using the GameMaker Studio 2 ","Image Editor",", or made with any external drawing program and imported into GameMaker\n      Studio 2. The image used doesn't have to be of a single static thing either... it can be a \"strip\" image too, ie: multiple images in a a single file which can then be used to make a single animated sprite. For example, the following\n      10 images form a sprite for a character who is waving his arms while skydiving.","\n      "," And the actual finished animation would look like this when placed in a game:","\n    "," A sprite like this is usually a ","PNG"," format file, but GameMaker Studio 2 will also accept vector sprites\n      in ","SWF"," format, and ","Spine ","sprites in ","JSON"," format (with their accompanying texture ","atlas"," file).","\n    ","The RMB "," menu for sprites contains the following options (as well as those listed further up this page):","\n    ","\n      ","Assign Texture Group"," - When you select this option, you will be presented with a list of the available texture groups, and you can then choose one to add the sprite to or create a new one, if required.

Basically a tile set is a single image that GameMaker Studio 2 will break into\n      separate sections based on the values you give for the various settings. You can then use these in the room editor (or procedurally through code) to generate a tile map in your room. They are great for designing any static items in your room, like\n      terrain, walls, backdrops, etc... as they don't have the same overhead that objects have.","\n    "," Above is an example sprite that would be used as a tile set to create walls. As you can see, it can be \"split\" into 64x64pixel chunks, which\n      would then placed into the room editor.","\n    ","NOTE: Tiles are always square, so if you need anything other than that, you should be using an instance with a sprite or an asset layer in the room editor.","\n    ","The RMB "," menu for tilesets contains the following option (as well as those listed further down this page):","\n    ","\n      ","Assign Texture Group"," - When you select this option, you will be presented with a list of the available texture groups, and you can then choose one to add the tileset to or create a new one, if required.

That's why we have the timeline resource. In a timeline you specify which actions must happen at any specific moment in game time, and you can use all the actions that are available for an object in its different\n      events as well as code. Once you create a time line you can then assign it to an object, and the instance of that object will then execute the actions and code at the indicated moments of time when placed or created within a room.","\n    ","You can find out more about adding timelines from the section on the ","Timeline Editor",".","\n    "," ","\n  ","\n  "," If you want a more in-depth guide as to how to use the different editors listed above then you please refer to the following section of the manual:","\n  ","\n    ","The Editors","\n  ","\n  "," ","\n  "," ","\n  ","\n    ","\n      ","\n        ","Back: ","Introduction To GameMaker Studio 2","\n        ","Next: ","Compiling","\n      ","\n    ","\n    ","\n  ","\n  ","\n  ","\n\n"],"4":["The Asset Browser","Tags","RMB Menu","Asset Types"],"5":["© Copyright YoYo Games Ltd. 2020 All Rights Reserved"],"id":"2616"})
