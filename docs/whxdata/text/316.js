These skins need to have been previously created and named in your animation program, and this name is passed into the function (as a string) to set the sprite\n    to use that skin when being drawn.","\n  "," ","\n  ","\n  ","skeleton_skin_set(skinname);","\n  ","\n    ","\n      ","\n        ","Argument","\n        ","Description","\n      ","\n      ","\n        ","skinname","\n        ","The name (a string) of the skin to use.","\n      ","\n    ","\n  ","\n  "," ","\n  ","\n  ","N/A","\n  "," ","\n  ","\n  ","if skeleton_skin_get() == \"skin_Enemy1\"","     {\n    ","     skeleton_skin_set(choose(\"skin_Enemy1\", \"skin_Enemy2\", \"skin_Enemy3\");","     }\n  ","\n  ","The above code would check the currently assigned skin for the animation and if it is \"skin_Enemy1\", it chooses and sets a new skin from one of three options.","\n  "," ","\n  "," ","\n  "," ","\n  ","\n    ","\n      ","\n        ","Back: ","Skins","\n        ","Next: ","skeleton_skin_list","\n      ","\n    ","\n    ","\n  ","\n  ","\n  ","\n\n"],"4":["skeleton_skin_set"],"5":["© Copyright YoYo Games Ltd. 2020 All Rights Reserved"],"7":["Syntax:","Returns:","Example:"],"id":"316"})
