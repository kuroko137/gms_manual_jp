You supply the variable that holds the grid index (as returned by the action ","Create Grid",") and then give the x and y position (the column\n    and row) for the cell to set, and then finally the value for that cell. The value can be any valid data type, but the x and y position must be whole integers within the bounds of the grid.","\n  "," ","\n  ","\n  ","\n  ","\n  ","\n    ","\n      ","\n        ","Argument","\n        ","Description","\n      ","\n      ","\n        ","Grid","\n        ","The index (stored in a variable) of the grid to set","\n      ","\n      ","\n        ","x","\n        ","The cell position along the x axis to set (the column)","\n      ","\n      ","\n        ","y","\n        ","The cell position along the y axis to set (the row)","\n      ","\n      ","\n        ","Value","\n        ","The value to set the grid cell to","\n      ","\n    ","\n  ","\n  "," ","\n  ","\n  ","The above action block code creates a new grid data structure and holds its index value\n    in a global variable.
