So if you do, for example:","\n  ","lerp(0, 10, 0.5)","\n  ","you would get the return value of 5, which is 50% of the input values. You can extrapolate using this function too, by supplying a positive or negative value for the interpolation amount so that doing something like:","\n  ","lerp(0, 10, 2)","\n  ","will return a value of 20.","\n  "," ","\n  ","\n  ","lerp(a, b, amt)","\n  ","\n    ","\n      ","\n        ","Argument","\n        ","Description","\n      ","\n      ","\n        ","a","\n        ","The first value.","\n      ","\n      ","\n        ","b","\n        ","The second value.","\n      ","\n      ","\n        ","amt","\n        ","The amount to interpolate.","\n      ","\n    ","\n  ","\n  "," ","\n  ","\n  ","Real","\n  "," ","\n  ","\n  ","xx = lerp(x, x + hspeed, room_speed);"," yy = lerp(y, y + vspeed, room_speed);","\n  ","The above code uses the linear interpolation function to predict where an instance would have moved to after one second of game time.","\n  "," ","\n  "," ","\n  "," ","\n  ","\n    ","\n      ","\n        ","Back: ","Number Functions","\n        ","Next: ","clamp","\n      ","\n    ","\n    ","\n  ","\n  ","\n  ","\n\n"],"4":["lerp"],"5":["© Copyright YoYo Games Ltd. 2020 All Rights Reserved"],"7":["Syntax:","Returns:","Example:"],"id":"1483"})
