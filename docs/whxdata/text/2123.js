However all blending in this way creates a duplicate\n    sprite which is then stored in the cache and used when required. This is far from optimal and if you use multiple colour changes it will slow down your games performance unless you activate WebGL. if you do not wish to use WebGL, then you can set\n    the font cache size to try and limit this should it be necessary using the function ","sprite_set_cache_size()",".","\n  ","NOTE",": This function may not work as expected when using skeleton animation sprites, and you may find that the function only draws the first frame of the default pose. You should be using the ","draw_skeleton_*"," functions instead.","\n  "," ","\n  ","\n  ","draw_sprite_ext( sprite, subimg, x, y, xscale, yscale, rot, colour, alpha );","\n  ","\n    ","\n      ","\n        ","Argument","\n        ","Description","\n      ","\n      ","\n        ","sprite","\n        ","The index of the sprite to draw.","\n      ","\n      ","\n        ","subimg","\n        ","The subimg (frame) of the sprite to draw (image_index or -1 correlate to the current frame of animation in the object).","\n      ","\n      ","\n        ","x","\n        ","The x coordinate of where to draw the sprite.","\n      ","\n      ","\n        ","y","\n        ","The y coordinate of where to draw the sprite.","\n      ","\n      ","\n        ","xscale","\n        ","The horizontal scaling of the sprite, as a multiplier: 1 = normal scaling, 0.5 is half etc...","\n      ","\n      ","\n        ","yscale","\n        ","The vertical scaling of the sprite as a multiplier: 1 = normal scaling, 0.5 is half etc...","\n      ","\n      ","\n        ","rot","\n        ","The rotation of the sprite. 0=right way up, 90=rotated 90 degrees counter-clockwise etc...","\n      ","\n      ","\n        ","colour","\n        ","The colour with which to blend the sprite.
