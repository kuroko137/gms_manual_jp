It is a ","pitch multiplier",", in that the input value multiplies the current pitch by that amount, so the default value of 1 is no pitch change,\n    while a value of less than 1 will lower the pitch and greater than 1 will raise the pitch. It is best to use small increments for this function as any value under 0 or over 5 may not be audible anyway.","\n  ","NOTE: ","If a sound is being looped through the emitter, the change in pitch will not be detected unless the sound is stopped and looped again!","\n  "," ","\n  ","\n  ","audio_emitter_pitch(emitter, pitch);","\n  ","\n    ","\n      ","\n        ","Argument","\n        ","Description","\n      ","\n      ","\n        ","emitter","\n        ","The index of the emitter to change.","\n      ","\n      ","\n        ","pitch","\n        ","The pitch multiplier (default 1).","\n      ","\n    ","\n  ","\n  "," ","\n  ","\n  ","N/A","\n  "," ","\n  ","\n  ","switch (gear)","    {\n    ","    case 1: audio_emitter_pitch(s_emit, 0.8); break;","    case 2: audio_emitter_pitch(s_emit, 0.9); break;","    case 3: audio_emitter_pitch(s_emit, 0.95); break;","    case 4: audio_emitter_pitch(s_emit, 1); break;","    case 5: audio_emitter_pitch(s_emit,\n    1.2); break;","    }\n  ","\n  ","The above code will change the pitch of the audio played from the emitter indexed in the variable \"s_emit\" based on the value of the variable \"gear\".","\n  "," ","\n  "," ","\n  "," ","\n  ","\n    ","\n      ","\n        ","Back: ","Audio Emitters","\n        ","Next: ","audio_emitter_set_listener_mask","\n        "," ","\n      ","\n    ","\n    ","\n  ","\n  ","\n  ","\n\n"],"4":["audio_emitter_pitch"],"5":["© Copyright YoYo Games Ltd. 2020 All Rights Reserved"],"7":["Syntax:","Returns:","Example:"],"id":"376"})
