Please note that if you do not call ","surface_reset_target()","    after you have finished, nothing will be drawn on the screen as all further drawing (even in other instances) will be done on the surface. You should also realise that nothing will be seen if the surface itself is not drawn on the screen in the draw\n    event of an instance. You can check the return value of this function too as a debug tool to check whether the surface target was set or not, with a return value of 0 being a failure to set the target and any other positive value being a success.","\n  ","One thing that should be noted is that surfaces are ","stacked"," so you cannot jump from target to target and then reset to the normal draw target at the end, but rather you must open and close rendering targets. For example, this will ","not","    work correctly:","\n  ","surface_set_target(surf1);"," draw_text(32, 32, \"surface1\");"," surface_set_target(surf2);\n    "," draw_text(32, 64, \"surface2\");"," surface_reset_target();\n  ","\n  ","Instead, you must reset the target for each of the surfaces that you set, much like you must use opening and closing brackets {} for code blocks. So the above should be written as either this:","\n  ","surface_set_target(surf1);"," draw_text(32, 32, \"surface1\");"," surface_reset_target();\n    "," surface_set_target(surf2);\n    "," draw_text(32, 64, \"surface2\");"," surface_reset_target();\n  ","\n  ","or as this:","\n  ","surface_set_target(surf1);"," draw_text(32, 32, \"surface1\");"," surface_set_target(surf2);\n    "," draw_text(32, 64, \"surface2\");"," surface_reset_target();\n    "," surface_reset_target();\n  ","\n  ","NOTE",": When working with surfaces there is the possibility that they can cease to exist at any time due to them being stored in texture memory.
