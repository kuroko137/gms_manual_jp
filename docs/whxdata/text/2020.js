Setting this option to \"OK\"\n      will simply okay the deletion without showing the message.","\n    ","Maximum size for DnD™ toolbox action thumbnails",": At the bottom of the Action Toolbox you have a slider for changing the size of the Drag and Drop icons. This setting will be used to define the maximum permitted size (default 64px).","\n    ","Minimum size for DnD™ toolbox action thumbnails",": At the bottom of the Action Toolbox you have a slider for changing the size of the Drag and Drop icons. This setting will be used to define the minimum permitted size (default 16px).","\n    ","Default size for DnD™ toolbox action thumbnails",": This setting will be used to define the default size for all action icons in the toolbox (default 32px).","\n    ","Maximum number of recently used actions to display",": In the action toolbox there is a library at the top which holds the actions you have most recently used. You can use this option to change the maximum number of recent actions that\n      will be shown (default 5).","\n    ","Thickness of the chain that connects DnD™ actions",": This defines the thickness of the chain graphic that links the different actions in a DnD code block (default 3px).","\n    ","Mouse down time to start dragging nodes (ms)",": When you click on a node and drag it, you will be re-positioning the node within the action code. However if you hold the mouse down for a moment and then move, you will be moving the\n      node position within the workspace but not within the order of the code. This setting sets the number of milliseconds to have to wait with the mouse button pressed before the node can be moved (not re positioned). Default is 350.","\n    ","Hide DnD™ node overview panel",": Here you can choose to hide the overview panel of the Action Code Editor. By default this is disabled and enabling it will remove the plain text list of action chains from the editor.","\n  ","\n  ","There is also a sub-menu for DnD™ comments:","\n  ","The Comments preferences control the different colour and formatting options for any comments that have\n    been added to your Drag and Drop™ action scripts.

You can choose to let the IDE decide by selecting ","Use Default",",\n      or you can force it ","On ","or ","Off ","by selecting either of those options.","\n  ","\n  "," ","\n  "," ","\n  ","\n    ","\n      ","\n        ","Back: ","IDE Preferences","\n        ","Next: ","Image Editor Preferences","\n      ","\n    ","\n    ","\n  ","\n  ","\n  ","\n\n"],"4":["Drag And Drop™  Preferences"],"5":["© Copyright YoYo Games Ltd. 2020 All Rights Reserved"],"id":"2020"})
