Since docks can be re-arranged and the contents can be removed as stand-alone windows or even closed entirely, this window permits you to re-open them if you find that you need them for anything.\n    The windows that can be opened from here are the ","Asset Browser"," window and all the different ","Output"," windows (Output, Search, Source Control,\n    Breakpoints and Compile/Syntax Errors).","\n  ","Next you can open the ","Inspector"," window. This window is used to inspect the properties of the currently selected IDE element, and these properties can then be edited as required.","\n  ","After the Inspector option you have the ","Recent Windows"," list, and there is also the option to open the ","Environment Variables"," window where you can see the different paths that the various environment\n    variables used in the ","Preferences"," point to. These variables cannot be edited (neither their name nor their path/setting) but you can select and copy/paste any of them for use\n    elsewhere.","\n  ","Finally you have the option to open ","Tutorial Windows",". This will re-open any windows that are related to a tutorial project\n    you have opened, but only if the project is one that was created as part of a tutorial (if not, this option will be unavailable).
