The function will return an id value which must be stored in a variable to be used in all\n    further button functions that reference the new icon. This function is very useful to prevent the browser creating a pop-up window when clicking on the button as it is all done through GameMaker Studio 2 itself.","\n  ","This function works exactly the same as the ","clickable_add()"," function, where you must set the position relative to the (0,0) of the browser window, give the texture page entry for the sprite you wish the button\n    icon to have (see: ","sprite_get_tpe()","), specify either a URL to open or a script (from the Asset Browser of GameMaker Studio 2) to be opened or run then\n    set the target and parameters to use. However this function also has two additional options that permit you to set the icon alpha from 0 (fully transparent) to 1 (fully opaque) and the scale of the icon, which is a multiplier value applied to the\n    sprite used. So a value of 1 is the default scale, while (for example) 0.5 would be half scale and 2 would be double.","\n  ","It is also worth noting that if the URL argument you pass in is the name of a ","script function"," (ie: it doesn't start with \"http://\") AND the script is called ","gmcallback_*","    then you can get direct feeds into an html5 event. GameMaker Studio 2 script function names are ","not"," obfuscated if they begin with ","gmcallback_",".","\n  "," ","\n  ","\n  ","clickable_add_ext(x, y, tpe, url, target, params, alpha, scale);","\n  ","\n    ","\n      ","\n        ","Argument","\n        ","Description","\n      ","\n      ","\n        ","x","\n        ","The x position within the ","window",".","\n      ","\n      ","\n        ","y","\n        ","The y position within the ","window",".","\n      ","\n      ","\n        ","tpe","\n        ","The texture page entry for the sprite to be used.","\n      ","\n      ","\n        ","url","\n        ","The URL (website address) to link to, or the script to be run.","\n      ","\n      ","\n        ","target","\n        ","This is the target area to open the URL in (see description).","\n      ","\n      ","\n        ","params","\n        ","The various parameters for the icon (see description).","\n      ","\n      ","\n        ","alpha","\n        ","The image alpha of the icon (default 1).","\n      ","\n      ","\n        ","scale","\n        ","The scale of the icon (default 1).","\n      ","\n    ","\n  ","\n  "," ","\n  ","\n  ","Real","\n  "," ","\n  ","\n  ","home_but = clickable_add_ext(32, 32, sprite_get_tpe(spr_MS_Home, 0), \"http://macsweeney_games.com\", \"_blank\", \"width=700, height=500, menubar=0, toolbar=0, scrollbars=0\", 1, 2);","\n  ","The above code creates a clickable DOM icon at the position (32, 32) of the page that the game canvas is running on.
