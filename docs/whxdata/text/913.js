This is far from optimal and if you use multiple colour changes it will slow down your games performance unless you activate WebGL. if you do not wish to use WebGL, then you can set\n    the font cache size to try and limit this should it be necessary using the function ","sprite_set_cache_sizee()",".","\n  "," ","\n  ","\n  ","draw_sprite_stretched_ext(sprite, subimg, x, y, w, h, colour, alpha);","\n  ","\n    ","\n      ","\n        ","Argument","\n        ","Description","\n      ","\n      ","\n        ","sprite","\n        ","The index of the sprite to draw.","\n      ","\n      ","\n        ","subimg","\n        ","The subimg (frame) of the sprite to draw (image_index or -1 correlate to the current frame of animation in the object).","\n      ","\n      ","\n        ","x","\n        ","The x coordinate of where to draw the sprite.","\n      ","\n      ","\n        ","y","\n        ","The y coordinate of where to draw the sprite.","\n      ","\n      ","\n        ","w","\n        ","The width of the area the stretched sprite will occupy.","\n      ","\n      ","\n        ","h","\n        ","The height of the area the stretched sprite will occupy.","\n      ","\n      ","\n        ","colour","\n        ","The colour with which to blend the sprite. c_white is to display it normally.","\n      ","\n      ","\n        ","alpha","\n        ","The alpha of the sprite (from 0 to 1 where 0 is transparent and 1 opaque).","\n      ","\n    ","\n  ","\n  "," ","\n  ","\n  ","N/A","\n  "," ","\n  ","\n  ","draw_sprite_stretched_ext(sprite_index, image_index, x, y, sprite_width / 2, sprite_height / 2, c_white, 0.5);","\n  ","This will draw the instances assigned sprite and its sub-image with the left corner at the instance x /y position.
