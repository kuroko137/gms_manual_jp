Layers can be added, removed, and sorted from the Layers Editor, and come in a variety of different types, each with their\n    own set of options and way of working. You aren't limited to the number of each type of layer, and can have multiple tile layers, or path layers, or instance layers, etc... Each type of layer has it's own ","properties window","    where you can set different things depending on the layer type. You can also toggle the layers visibility, with invisible layers ","not ","being processed at runtime (but you can make them visible again at any time using the appropriate ","layer function",").","\n  ","The image above shows the layer editor, with the current layers being listed at the top, and the different buttons for creating layers at the bottom.\n    You can rename any layer from this editor by doing a slow double click on the name (note that you cannot use anything except letters numbers and the underbar \"_\" character for names) and you can also switch its visibility on or off by clicking\n    the eye icon ",". If the room has inherited layers from a parent room, you can toggle the inheritance from the button at the bottom, but note that\n    this will affect all layers (see ","here"," for more information on inheritance). You can also use "," or "," / "," and left click "," on multiple layers to select them for duplication or deletion (these options are also available from the right mouse "," Menu).","\n  ","To help with ordering your layers and keeping them tidy, you can create groups of layers in a layer folder by clicking the folder icon ",". You\n    can also delete one or more selected layers by clicking the delete button ",". All layers will have a ","depth ","value,\n    which defines where in the draw order that layer will be placed when its contents are ","rendered"," in the room. Layers are drawn from the ","highest ","depth to the ","lowest",", so a layer\n    at a depth of -100 will be drawn ","over ","a layer with a depth of 200.","\n  ","IMPORTANT!"," There is a minimum and maximum layer depth of -16000 to 16000. Anything placed on a layer outside that range will not be drawn although all events will still run as normal for anything on the layer.","\n  ","If you right-click "," on any layer you get the layer menu:","\n  ","Here you can open the layer properties window for the selected layer, delete the layer, rename the layer, or add a ","sub layer",".\n    If you choose to add a sub layer, then the current layer will receive a \"folder\" icon to show that there are sub-layers attached, and the new layer will be created below it, tabbed to the right. You can then choose to have the sub-layer\n    inherit its properties from the parent layer, and also set whether it should inherit the visibility from the parent layer.","\n  ","Note that you can drag layers up or down in the window to re-order them, and you can select and move multiple layers too using either "," + "," to select from one layer to another (including all those in between) or "," / "," + "," to select layers one at a time. If you place the layers\n    on top of a layer folder, they will be moved and set as sub-layers of the folder you dropped them on to. You can also lock layers so that they cannot be edited by mistake using the lock button ",".","\n  ","NOTE",": In the actual editor window where you place the different assets on their layers, you can hold down \"","P","\" + anywhere to instantly select the asset and skip to the layer that it has been placed\n    on.","\n  ","Below you can find an overview of each of the available layer types as well as the editable properties for that layer:","\n  "," ","\n  ","Backgrounds","Backgrounds","\n  ","\n    ","You can add a new background layer by clicking on the "," button. This will add the new layer, and then open up the background\n      properties window:","\n    ","\n    ","When you create a new background layer it is empty by default and so draws the defined background colour. If you do not assign a sprite for the background layer image, this is what will be drawn instead, and you can click the colour box to open the\n      colour picker and change the colour used. If you do choose a sprite, then you can tick the tiling options to tile it horizontally or vertically, or to make it stretch the image to fill the whole room.","\n    ","If you want to have the background scroll in a direction, you can set the horizontal and/or vertical speed too (each game step it will move along the given access by the number of pixels that you set here), and you can also re-position the background\n      image by setting the x and y offset values. You can also set the animation speed for the background if the sprite resource that you have selected has multiple sub-images, although this is locked by default to the value that you set in the Sprite\n      Editor for the image used. Finally you can set the depth for the layer explicitly, although again by default this is locked and you can simply drag and reorder the layer order in the Layer Editor to change this value.","\n    ","Note that you can toggle the inheritance for a background from this window too by clicking the button at the very top.","\n    "," ","\n  ","\n  ","Instances","Instances","\n  ","\n    ","You can add a new instance layer by clicking on the "," button. This will add the new layer, and then open up the instance properties\n      window:","\n    ","This window simply shows a list of all the instances that are currently on the layer. You can add more instances to a layer\n      by opening up the ","Asset Browser"," and then dragging objects from there into the room, or alternatively you can select an instance from the Asset Browser and then press and hold "," to preview the resource \"in-situ\", and if you additionally click the left mouse button "," you can add the instance and even \"paint\" it into the room layer by maintaining the button pressed and moving the mouse.","\n    ","The layer list can be ordered by clicking "," and dragging an instance in the list to the position required, but it is worth noting that this is purely for organisational\n      purposes within the room editor and if you want to set a specific creation order, please use the ","Creation Order Window",", which can be opened from the ","Room Properties"," window, or from the ","Room context menu",".","\n    ","Double-clicking "," on any instance - either in the room editor itself or in the properties list - will open a new window to let you modify aspects of that single unique\n      instance:","\n    ","By default the instance will have a name like \"","inst_38B0BFF","\", but this can be changed\n      to anything you want as long as the name uses only alpha-numeric characters and the under-bar \"_\" (and no spaces). However it's worth noting that the name given here (whether it's one you give, or the default one that the IDE gives)\n      is considered a ","constant"," and so ","must be ","unique ","to the instance",". This also means that it can be used in code n your game to identify the instance, but only if you\n      are in the same room as the instance.","\n    ","Below the instance name you have buttons to set whether the instance is to inherit from the parent room, change the object that you want it to be an instance of or even open up the ","Object Editor",", should you wish to change\n      anything there. There is a button to check and edit variables through the ","Object Variable"," window and you can change the initial characteristics of this instance too, setting a colour to blend\n      it with (white by default), or rotating and flipping it. You can also scale the instance along either or both the axis, and set its position within the room, as well as the image speed and initial frame for the sprite to use.","\n    ","Finally you can give the instance some creation code which will run directly after the object creation event code, and is unique to this instance (so you can, say, set a variable in the object which all instance will have then modify it in the creation\n      code so that it's a unique value for one instance). Clicking this will chain a ","script window"," to the instance where you can add any functions or modify any variables and this code will be run directly after the instance\n      has been created and the instance ","Create Event"," has been run. Note that you can toggle inheritance of creation code on or off ","independently ","of the instance inheritance.","\n    ","It is worth noting that each instance on a layer is automatically flagged for exporting when the game is made. However, especially when working with inheritance, it may be that you don't ","want ","specific instances to be added to the room\n      in the final game (or you may have a debug instance in every room and simply want to exclude it from the final game). If that is the case, then simply un-checking the \"","Export","\" checkbox to the left of the instance in the\n      list will prevent it from being exported as part of the executable. It is important to note, however, that if you have any code that references the instance, ","then the game will not run correctly",", so use this feature with care.","\n    "," ","\n  ","\n  ","Tile Maps","Tile Maps","\n  ","\n    ","You can add a new ","tile map"," layer by clicking on the "," button. This will add the new layer, and then open up the ","Tile Map Layer Properties"," window and the ","Tile Editing ","window:","\n    ","In the ","Tile Map Layer Properties"," you can toggle the inheritance fo the layer, change the tile set that is being\n      used and set the x or y offset for the layer if you want the layer grid to not align exactly with the (0, 0) position of the room. You can also set the depth that the layer should be ","rendered","      at (which has it's own unique inheritance button) and you can \"lock\" this depth too, which will prevent any further editing after it has been created.","\n    ","When the layer properties window opens it will also open the ","Tile Editing"," window, which shows the tile set being used (if you close this window by mistake, you can open it again from the ","Room ","> ","Tile Editing","      menu at the top of the IDE). You can click "," on any tile to select it as the current ","brush ","and then draw them to the layer in the room editor by clicking\n      "," on the room canvas, or, if you want to draw multiple tiles together you can select them as a group by clicking the left mouse "," and dragging to select them from the tileset before drawing. If the range of tiles that you want to draw together is not in a block, then you can hold down "," / "," and then select individual tiles using the left mouse button "," and create a custom brush that way (you can also remove tiles from a custom brush using "," + ","). Note that creating custom brushes this way is temporary and designed for one-off uses, but you can use the ","Brushes"," tab to create permanent brushes that will be stored with the tile map layer. ","\n    ","Note that the Tile Editing window permits you to zoom in and out on the tile with the mouse wheel or the buttons at the top, and you can pan using the "," middle mouse button\n      or "," + ",". Note that there is a\n      grid option too which can be toggled on or off to delimit the tiles in the window, and you can set the colour of the grid as well, although tiles will ","always"," be snapped to the grid whether it is visible or not.","\n    ","The Tile Editing window also permits you to select ","Brushes",", ","Animated Tiles"," and ","Auto Tiles"," from the Libraries tab, all of which are covered in the section on the ","Tile Set Editor",".","\n    ","At the top of the room editor, when you have a tile layer selected, you will see a set of tools that are specific to tiles:","\n    ","\n      ","\n        ","\n          ","\n          ","Pencil","\n          ","This is the pencil tool.
