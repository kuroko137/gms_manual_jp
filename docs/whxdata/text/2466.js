You supply the sound resource to get the length of and a target variable to return the value too (or you can flag the target as a temp variable to have the action create the variable\n    for use until the end of the event or script). The length will be returned to the target variable (which can be made temporary) in seconds and can be a decimal value.","\n  "," ","\n  ","\n  ","\n  ","\n  ","\n    ","\n      ","\n        ","Argument","\n        ","Description","\n      ","\n      ","\n        ","Sound","\n        ","The sound resource to get the length of","\n      ","\n      ","\n        ","Target","\n        ","The target variable to store the return value","\n      ","\n    ","\n  ","\n  "," ","\n  ","\n  ","The above action block code gets the playing length of the given sound resource and stores\n    it in a temporary local variable.

This new random value is then used to set the start position for the\n    sound and the sound is then played.","\n  "," ","\n  "," ","\n  "," ","\n  ","\n    ","\n      ","\n        ","Back: ","Audio Actions","\n        ","Next: ","Set Audio Pitch","\n      ","\n    ","\n    ","\n  ","\n  ","\n  ","\n\n"],"4":[" Get Audio Length"],"5":["© Copyright YoYo Games Ltd. 2020 All Rights Reserved"],"7":["Action Syntax:","Arguments:","Example:"],"id":"2466"})
