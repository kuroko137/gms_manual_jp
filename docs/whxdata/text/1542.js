So, when two instances collide, their motion is affected by this value, with a high friction causing a larger loss of momentum than a lower value. Note that the friction is usually set to a value between 0 and 1, but you can use any non-negative\n    value if required.","\n  "," ","\n  ","\n  ","physics_fixture_set_friction(fixture, friction)","\n  ","\n    ","\n      ","\n        ","Argument","\n        ","Description","\n      ","\n      ","\n        ","fixture","\n        ","the index of the fixture","\n      ","\n      ","\n        ","friction","\n        ","the friction of the fixture","\n      ","\n    ","\n  ","\n  "," ","\n  ","\n  ","N/A","\n  "," ","\n  ","\n  ","physics_fixture_set_friction(fix_Brick, 0.1);","\n  ","The code above will set the friction of the fixture indexed in \"fix_brick\" to 0.1.","\n  "," ","\n  "," ","\n  "," ","\n  ","\n    ","\n      ","\n        ","Back: ","Fixtures","\n        ","Next: ","physics_fixture_set_linear_damping","\n      ","\n    ","\n    ","\n  ","\n  ","\n  ","\n\n"],"4":["physics_fixture_set_friction"],"5":["© Copyright YoYo Games Ltd. 2020 All Rights Reserved"],"7":["Syntax:","Returns:","Example:"],"id":"1542"})
