The input values here are modifiers which will be applied to the sprite assigned to the instance, where a scale of 1 (the default value) indicates no\n    scaling (1:1), smaller values will scale down (0.5, for example, will half the width of the sprite), and larger values will scale up. You can use negative values to flip the sprite and scale it unless the value used is exactly -1 (in which case the\n    sprite is just flipped or mirrored about its origin with no scaling). You can choose to set the horizontal or vertical scale relative to the current values, in which case you will be adding or subtracting the new value from the current scale values.","\n  ","Note that changing these values will also change how the instance detects collisions, unless you have supplied a separate ","mask_index"," (collision mask) in the ","Object Editor",".
