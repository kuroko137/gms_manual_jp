For example, if a particle has 0.5, 1 and 0 as the alpha values, and a lifetime of 60 game frames, then when it is created (frame 0) it will\n    at 0.5 alpha, then it will fade towards a full alpha of 1 (frame 30), before fading on to be invisible with an alpha of 0 (frame 60).","\n  "," ","\n  ","\n  ","\n  ","\n  ","\n    ","\n      ","\n        ","Argument","\n        ","Description","\n      ","\n      ","\n        ","Type ID","\n        ","The unique ID value for the particle type to set the colour of","\n      ","\n      ","\n        ","Start","\n        ","The initial alpha to use","\n      ","\n      ","\n        ","Middle","\n        ","The in between alpha to use","\n      ","\n      ","\n        ","End","\n        ","The final alpha to use","\n      ","\n    ","\n  ","\n  "," ","\n  ","\n  ","The above action block code will create a new particle type and assign its unique\n    ID value to a global variable.
