When you do, your submission will be complete, but note that all registrations have to be verified by YoYo Games, so your new Publisher\n    will not be available to you straight away. When your registration is verified you will be notified via the email address you provided. (Please note that we operate standard UK business hours, so weekend applications, etc., will see a delay in your\n    approval.)","\n  ","Once you submit the registration you will be taken to your Publisher Account, where you can see the details already given and edit them, as well\n    as upload an avatar:","\n  ","You should now go the Payment Details section and fill out the form there:","\n  ","Please note that:","\n  ","\n    ","Currently the Marketplace only offers payment through ","PayPal",", so when creating a publisher account you will be required to give a valid email for a PayPal account, otherwise you cannot be paid.","\n    ","For users from the UK/EU, a valid VAT number should be set if this applies to your organisation (for users outside of the UK, you should precede your VAT number with the two-digit country code for your country).","\n  ","\n  ","If you are planning on only uploading free assets to the Marketplace, then you can ignore the PayPal and VAT fields.  You can then click the ","Submit"," button to continue.","\n  ","Once your registration has been verified, you can then use the rest of the options from the ","Publisher Console",".

For more information on publishing assets, please see the page: ","Listing An Asset",".","\n    ","Services",": Here you can see the services that you offer to other Marketplace users, as well as edit their details and update or add new ones.
