This means that you need to take care not to create cameras unnecessarily and to destroy those that you don't need by calling the function ","camera_destroy()",".\n    This also means that cameras will persist from room to room if assigned to a ","global"," variable (they will persist when assigned to instance or local variables too, but you can't access them after changing room, hence the memory leak), so\n    that you can - for example - create a new camera, assign it to a global variable, and then at the start of each room set the required view and projection matrices and the view port you need to use.","\n  "," ","\n  ","\n  ","camera_create();","\n  "," ","\n  ","\n  ","Real (unique camera ID value)","\n  "," ","\n  ","\n  ","view_camera[0] = camera_create();"," var viewmat = matrix_build_lookat(640, 240, -10, 640, 240, 0, 0, 1, 0);"," var projmat = matrix_build_projection_ortho(640, 480, 1.0, 32000.0);"," camera_set_view_mat(view_camera[0], viewmat);"," camera_set_proj_mat(view_camera[0],\n    projmat);","\n  ","The above code creates a new camera and assigns its ID to view[0].
