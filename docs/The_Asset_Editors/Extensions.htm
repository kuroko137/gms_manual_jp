  <h1>The Extension Editor</h1>
  <p>An <strong>extension package</strong> can be used to add a number of additional functions and <a class="tooltip" title="A constant is a term used to describe a named value that does not change throughout the execution of the program. GameMaker Studio 2 has a number of built-in constants - for example os_windows - but you can also create your own constant values for use in your projects (called Macros) and extensions.">constant</a><span class="glossextra"></span> to the GameMaker Language (GML), or as a way to transfer game assets or even whole projects easily between people. If the extension is to add extra functionality, then the functions used can link your game to external <a class="tooltip" title="SDK stands for 'Software Development Kit'. This usually refers to a collection of software and/or packages used for developing applications for a specific device or operating system.">SDK</a><span class="glossextra"></span> or <a class="tooltip" title="Source code is the fundamental component of a computer program that is required for the program to run.">source code</a> written in other languages (like Java for Android, for example), as well as native GML.</p>
  <p><img alt="Extensions Properties" class="center" src="../assets/Images/Asset_Editors/Editor_Extensions.png" style="width: 100%; max-width: 465px;" />Normally 3rd party extensions will be from the <a href="https://marketplace.yoyogames.com/">GameMaker Marketplace</a> and those you have subscribed to will then be listed in the <a href="../Introduction/The_Marketplace.htm">Marketplace Library</a> window and can be installed from there. If you did not get your extension package from the Marketplace, you can still add it to a project by again right-clicking <img alt="RMB Icon" class="icon" src="../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_RMB.png" style="width: 100%; max-width: 21px;" /> anywhere in the <a href="../Introduction/The_Asset_Browser.htm">Asset Browser</a> and this selecting <em>Add Existing</em>, then browsing to the location of the extension to select it.</p>
  <p>If you have a <span class="inline">*.GMEZ</span> created with a previous version of GameMaker Studio you can add these by selecting the right mouse button <img alt="RMB Icon" class="icon" src="../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_RMB.png" style="width: 100%; max-width: 21px;" /> menu option <em>Import Extension</em>.</p>
  <p class="note"><strong>NOTE</strong>: Legacy format <span class="inline">*.GEX</span> extensions are no longer supported and cannot be imported in to GameMaker Studio 2 projects.</p>
  <p>Once you have added an extension to the Asset Browser, you should give it a name and a version number and also set which platforms you want to export it to. By un-ticking selected platforms, you can tell GameMaker Studio 2 not to export the extension as part of the executable for those platforms. You should also ensure that the extension properties match up with the target platform(s), and edit the export targets for the extension files based on the following:</p>
  <ul class="colour">
    <li class="dropspot"><strong>All targets</strong>: GML extensions. These are extensions made using the GameMaker Language (GML) and are compatible with all target platforms.</li>
    <li class="dropspot"><strong>Windows (Standard, UWP, XBoxOne)</strong>: You can use windows <span class="inline">DLL</span> files (Dynamic Link Libraries). Please note that if you have checked the "Use x64 Windows Runtime" in the <a href="../Settings/Game_Options/Windows.htm">Windows Game Options</a>, then all DLLs for the project <strong>must be 64bit compatible</strong>. 32bit DLLs will not work with the 64bit executable.</li>
    <li class="dropspot"><strong>macOS</strong>: The macOS target can use the standard <span class="inline">DyLib</span> files for extensions.</li>
    <li class="dropspot"><strong>Ubuntu (Linux)</strong>: For the Ubuntu target you need to make sure that your extension uses <span class="inline">SO</span> files.</li>
    <li class="dropspot"><strong>HTML5</strong>: These platforms can use <span class="inline">JavaScript</span> extensions.</li>
    <li class="dropspot"><strong>Android</strong>: This platform requires an extension to be written in <span class="inline">Java</span> or an <span class="inline">Android Framework SDK</span>.</li>
    <li class="dropspot"><strong>iOS</strong> / <strong> tvOS</strong>: Extensions for this platform are written in Objective C and require a <span class="inline">*.mm</span> and a <span class="inline">*.h</span> file, or if using any Frameworks, a pre-compiled <span class="inline">*.a</span> native file.</li>
    <li class="dropspot"><strong>PlayStation</strong>: For PlayStation 3 or 4 your extensions should be <span class="inline">PRX</span> files, with each target requiring a different <span class="inline">PRX</span> to conform to specification of the target (either PS3 or PS4). If working on a PSVita, the extension should be <span class="inline">SUPRX</span> instead.</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="note"><strong>NOTE</strong>: Some extensions are required to follow specific naming conventions for GameMaker to correctly identify the platform and CPU architecture they are designed for. Please see the section on <a href="Extension_Creation/Creating_An_Extension.htm">Creating Extensions</a> for more information.</p>
  <p>Since a single extension can have various associated files, it's possible to create a single extension for multiple platforms, in which case you want to specify <em>all </em>the compatible platforms in the main extension editor (ie: tick the checkbox beside them) and then in the individual file properties for each part of the extension, set the platform that those files should be exported to.</p>
  <p>To change the target platform for a specific extension file or placeholder you must first open the extension properties (double click <img alt="LMB Icon" class="icon" src="../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_LMB.png" style="width: 100%; max-width: 21px;" /> the extension in the Asset Browser or use <img alt="RMB Icon" class="icon" src="../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_RMB.png" style="width: 100%; max-width: 21px;" /> and select <em>Open Properties</em>), and then once in the extension properties select the resource file from the right that you want to edit:</p>
  <p class="dropspot"><img alt="Extension Target Platforms" class="center" src="../assets/Images/Asset_Editors/Editor_Extensions_Targets.png" style="width: 100%; max-width: 1049px;" /></p>
  <p class="note"><strong>NOTE</strong>: If you are exporting to the macOS or Ubuntu target, then you can set the "Uncompress as zip file" option to preserve file permissions for the extension.</p>
  <p>Once you have installed your extension, you can use the functions and constants for it just as you would the built in functions and constants used in the GameMaker Language. If your game is cross-platform (for example, it is designed to run on both Windows and Android targets), then you should use the <a href="../GameMaker_Language/GML_Reference/OS_And_Compiler/OS_And_Compiler.htm">OS constants and functions</a> to check the platform before calling extension specific functions to prevent issues, for example:</p>
  <p class="code">switch(os_type)<br />     { <br />     case os_android:<br />         call_android_extension_function(x, y, z);<br />         break; <br />     case os_windows:<br />         call_windows_extension_function(x, y, z);<br />         break; <br />     }
  </p>
  <p>Note that for different platforms your extensions can share function names, so if you have an extension with distinct files to (for example) pop up a message for Windows and for Android, both extension files can share the same function name as long as they are both set to export only to their respective platforms.</p>
  <p>If you want to create your won extensions, then you can find the basic required information from the following pages:</p>
  <ul class="colour">
    <li><a href="Extension_Creation/Creating_An_Extension.htm">Creating An Extension</a></li>
    <li><a href="Extension_Creation/Android_Extensions.htm">Android Extensions</a></li>
    <li><a href="Extension_Creation/iOS_Extensions.htm">iOS / tvOS Extensions</a></li>
  </ul>

  <h1>YoYo Games 3rd Party Extensions</h1>
  <p>Legacy versions of GameMaker had a lot of 3rd party functionality built in, but this was inefficient and difficult to maintain, since if any specific functionality was changed by the third party, then the whole GameMaker <a class="tooltip" title="The IDE, or Integrated Development Environment, is a software application that provides comprehensive facilities to computer programmers for software development. In this case, the entire frontend of GameMaker Studio 2 is considered the IDE, and includes sections to create graphics, add sounds, and add code to make your games.">IDE</a> and <a class="tooltip" title="The runtime in GameMaker Studio 2 is the collection of compiler assets that is required by the program to create a final executable package for a given target platform. These are installed seperately from the IDE, and can be changed and updated at any time.">Runtime</a> would have to be updated. So, current versions have adopted the use of extensions packages to add third party support to your games. This means that you can add only those extra functions that you require and that you can even adapt and edit them to suit your specific needs.</p>
  <p>Most of these extensions will be downloaded and installed for you when you select a specific <a href="../Settings/Game_Options.htm">Game Options</a> (like Facebook or Google Mobile Ads, for example), but you can find further information about them from the appropriate section for each platform on the YoYo Games Knowledge Base:</p>
  <ul class="colour">
    <li><a href="https://help.yoyogames.com/hc/en-us/categories/204246668-GameMaker-Studio-2">GameMaker Studio 2 Platforms And Setup</a></li>
  </ul>
  <p>You can find the extensions themselves from the following Marketplace page:</p>
  <ul class="colour">
    <li><a href="https://marketplace.yoyogames.com/publishers/23/yoyo-games">YoYo Games Marketplace Assets</a></li>
  </ul>
  <p>Note that these extensions come with a demo and a help file (in <span class="inline">*.pdf</span> format) that explains how to use them, and as such their functions are not covered in the manual.</p>
