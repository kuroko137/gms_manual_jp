  <h1>The Asset Browser</h1>
  <p>The core of your game will be created from assets added to the <strong>Asset Browser</strong> located by default on the right of the <a class="tooltip" title="The IDE, or Integrated Development Environment, is a software application that provides comprehensive facilities to computer programmers for software development. In this case, the entire frontend of GameMaker Studio 2 is considered the IDE, and includes sections to create graphics, add sounds, and add code to make your games.">IDE</a>. This is where you can add everything that your game requires to run, including a game room, <a class="tooltip" title="スプライトとは、1つの大きなシーンの部品となるビットマップ画像です。静止画、動画のどちらも該当します。">sprites</a>, objects, paths and a number of other things. A basic game in GameMaker Studio 2 will require a room to run in (new projects will always be created with a room asset already created), and usually at least one object and a sprite, although you'll likely use a lot more!</p>
  <p><img alt="The Asset Browser Components" class="center" src="../assets/Images/Introduction/QS_AssetBrowser.png" style="width: 100%; max-width: 807px;" /></p>
  <p>The Asset Browser is where you'll create and organise the assets for your game as well as modify certain other aspects like platform specific settings and configurations. Below you can find explanations of each of the different sections.</p>
  <p><a class="dropspot" data-rhwidget="DropSpot" data-target="drop_down" href="#"><span data-open-text="true">Search Bar</span><span data-close-text="true">Search Bar</span></a></p>
  <div class="droptext" data-targetname="drop_down">
    <p class="dropspot">The Search Bar is where you can type in some text and use it to filter what is shown in the main asset list below. For example typing "room" will show you all the assets that contain "room" in their name. To reset the asset list back to it's default view, simply delete any text from the search bar.</p>
    <p class="dropspot"> </p>

  <div class="droptext" data-targetname="drop_down1">
    <p class="dropspot">With the Add Asset button you can choose to add a new asset to the asset list. Clicking this will open the following window:</p>
    <p class="dropspot"><img alt="Create Asset Window" class="center" src="../assets/Images/Introduction/QS_AssetBrowser_AddAsset.png" style="width: 100%; max-width: 614px;" /></p>
    <p class="dropspot">You can choose which of the two views above to use by clicking either the <img alt="List Icon" class="icon" src="../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_List.png" style="width: 100%; max-width: 20px;" /> list icon or <img alt="Grid Icon" class="icon" src="../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_Grid.png" style="width: 100%; max-width: 20px;" /> grid icon, and you can also click the <img alt="Import Icon" class="icon" src="../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_Import.png" style="width: 100%; max-width: 20px;" /> Import icon to import an already existing asset from another project. If you don't want to import anything, then simply select the asset you want to create and click the Create button at the bottom. Note that you are not limited to adding only a single asset here, as you can set the number to create at the bottom of the window, and then click Create and that number of the chosen asset will be added to the asset browser for you. All assets created in this way will be added to the bottom of the asset list, outside of any folders, and also will be opened in the current workspace ready for editing.</p>
    <p class="dropspot">The assets that you can add here are listed further down in this section of the manual.</p>

    <p class="dropspot">Clicking the Asset Filter button will open the following window:</p>
    <p class="dropspot"><img alt="Asset Browser Filter Options" class="center" src="../assets/Images/Introduction/QS_AssetBrowser_AssetFilter.png" style="width: 100%; max-width: 220px;" />Here you can choose how to filter and display the assets listed in the asset browser. You can order them from A - Z or from Z - A as well as choose to order the folders first and then the assets within the folders, or order everything altogether. If you select the <strong>Custom Order</strong> filter, then you can select one or more assets and drag them up or down the asset browser tree and position them as you require (note that the "folders first" option will be disabled).</p>
    <p class="dropspot">You can also select one or more asset type to filter and only the assets that are in the project of those types will be shown in the asset list. Selecting "Any Type" will reset the filter. You can also filter using any tags that you have assigned (tags are discussed further down in this section of the manual). Note that if you have selected any filter other than "Any Type" then the filter button will change colour to give a visual indication that filtering is active.</p>

  <div class="droptext" data-targetname="drop_down4">
    <p class="dropspot">This section of the asset browser is used to give you various methods to quickly access important or frequently used assets, and is split into the following sections:</p>
    <ul class="dropspotlist">
      <li class="dropspot"><strong>Recent</strong>: Here you can find a list of the most recently used assets. By default a maximum of 10 assets will be listed here, but you can change this from the <a href="../Setting_Up_And_Version_Information/IDE_Preferences/Asset_Browser_Preferences.htm">Asset Browser Preferences</a>.</li>
      <li class="dropspot"><strong>Favourites</strong>: Once you have added some assets to the asset list, you may have some that you access frequently at any given time and so to make things easier you can flag these assets as "favourites", which will add them to this list and let you quickly find them. To flag an asset as a <em>favourite</em> use the right mouse button <img alt="Icon RMB" class="icon" src="../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_RMB.png" style="width: 100%; max-width: 21px;" /> on it and select Favourite from the pop-up menu. Note that you can use the right mouse button <img alt="Icon RMB" class="icon" src="../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_RMB.png" style="width: 100%; max-width: 21px;" /> again to <em>unfavourite </em>any asset, and if you use the button on the main Favourites folder, you can select <em>Clear All</em> to remove everything.</li>
      <li class="dropspot"><strong>Room Order</strong>: From here you can change the order that your rooms will run in. All projects require at least one room to run and the room at the top of the list is the "home" room and will be the first room entered when the game initially starts (it is flagged with a "home" icon <img alt="The Home Room Icon" class="icon" src="../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_AssetHome.png" style="width: 100%; max-width: 20px;" />). To quickly change room order, simply click <img alt="LMB Icon" class="icon" src="../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_LMB.png" style="width: 100%; max-width: 21px;" /> and drag the room up or down the list and then release the mouse button to place it at the new position. If you click the "home" icon, then you will open the <strong>Room Manager</strong> and if you use the right mouse button <img alt="Icon RMB" class="icon" src="../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_RMB.png" style="width: 100%; max-width: 21px;" /> on a room you can create a <strong>child </strong>room. For more information on room order and child rooms please see the page on the <a href="../Settings/The_Room_Manager.htm">Room Manager</a>.</li>
      <li class="dropspot"><strong>Saved Filters</strong>: When using the filtering options, you may want to save the selection you've made for future reference. To do that, set up the filter as explained further up this page, and then click the right mouse button <img alt="Icon RMB" class="icon" src="../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_RMB.png" style="width: 100%; max-width: 21px;" /> on this option and select <em>Save Filter</em>. The filter will be saved to this list and you can rename it if required. To use the filter, simply double click <img alt="LMB Icon" class="icon" src="../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_LMB.png" style="width: 100%; max-width: 21px;" /> on it or use the right mouse button <img alt="Icon RMB" class="icon" src="../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_RMB.png" style="width: 100%; max-width: 21px;" /> menu option <em>Apply Filter</em>. You can also <em>Delete </em>and <em>Rename </em>saved filters from the RMB <img alt="Icon RMB" class="icon" src="../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_RMB.png" style="width: 100%; max-width: 21px;" /> menu.</li>
      <li class="dropspot"><strong>Tags</strong>: All assets in the Asset Browser can be assigned user-defined <strong>Tags</strong>. These will then be listed here and you can use them to filter the assets shown in the asset list and you can double-click <img alt="LMB Icon" class="icon" src="../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_LMB.png" style="width: 100%; max-width: 21px;" /> any tag (or use the right mouse button <img alt="Icon RMB" class="icon" src="../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_RMB.png" style="width: 100%; max-width: 21px;" /> option <em>Filter By Tag</em>) to apply that tag to the asset list filter. Any applied tags are shown at the bottom of the asset browser in the <strong>Information </strong>section. For more information on tags, see further down in this page.</li>
      <li class="dropspot"><strong>Game Options</strong>: Here you can quickly access the various different <strong>Game Options</strong> for your project. These control various different aspects of the project related to setting up and compiling for the different target platforms (what Game Options are available will depend on what licence type you have). You can find more information on each of the options listed from the section on the <a href="../Settings/Game_Options.htm">Game Options</a>.</li>

  <div class="droptext" data-targetname="drop_down11">
    <p class="dropspot">This section of the asset browser lists all the different assets that you are using in your game. By default - when you create a new project - this will be populated with numerous folder groups labelled with the different kinds of assets that can be added, but these can be renamed or even removed and you don't have to store assets of the same kind in each group. For example, you may find it more useful to ceate a group of assets for each level of your game rather than for each kind of asset, so you can create folder groups called "Level 1", "Level 2", etc... and store all the different assets for each level in the same folder. How you organise things really is up to you!</p>
    <p class="dropspot"><img alt="Asset Browser Example" class="center" src="../assets/Images/Introduction/QS_AssetBrowser_CustomList.png" style="width: 100%; max-width: 285px;" /> To add a new asset to the list you can use the <strong>Add Asset</strong> button at the top of the Asset Browser, or you can open the right mouse button <img alt="Icon RMB" class="icon" src="../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_RMB.png" style="width: 100%; max-width: 21px;" /> menu anywhere in the asset list and then select the resource to create:</p>
    <p class="dropspot"><img alt="Create Asset RMB Menu" class="center" src="../assets/Images/Introduction/QS_AssetBrowser_CreateAsset.png" style="width: 100%; max-width: 536px;" /> Once the asset has been created it will be opened in the workspace and you can rename it to something that is appropriate to your game, but note that asset names can only be alpha-numeric, cannot start with a number, and can only use the underscore "_" as an additional character. You can also use the right button menu to create new folder groups to contain assets using the <strong>Create Group</strong> option, and these can be named anything you wish. If you want to rename any asset or folder group, then you can do a slow double-click <img alt="LMB Icon" class="icon" src="../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_LMB.png" style="width: 100%; max-width: 21px;" /> on them or use the RMB <img alt="Icon RMB" class="icon" src="../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_RMB.png" style="width: 100%; max-width: 21px;" /> menu option <em>Rename</em>.</p>
    <p class="dropspot">An important feature of the asset browser is the ability to colour assets so they are more immediately recognisable within the list. You can do this by clicking the right mouse button <img alt="Icon RMB" class="icon" src="../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_RMB.png" style="width: 100%; max-width: 21px;" /> on the asset list node on the left and then selecting a colour from the colour picker palette that pops up. If you do this on a folder, then this will also colour any asset contained within the folder:</p>
    <p class="dropspot"><img alt="Colour Asset Groups" class="center" src="../assets/Images/Introduction/QS_AssetBrowser_ColourGroup.gif" style="width: 100%; max-width: 338px;" />Note that when opening the colour picker palette from a node like this, you can then right-click <img alt="Icon RMB" class="icon" src="../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_RMB.png" style="width: 100%; max-width: 21px;" /> on any of the colour swatches to generate a custom colour to use.</p>
    <p class="dropspot">Individual assets can also be coloured independently of the group colour by using the RMB <img alt="Icon RMB" class="icon" src="../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_RMB.png" style="width: 100%; max-width: 21px;" /> on the asset note or by using the palette at the bottom of the RMB <img alt="Icon RMB" class="icon" src="../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_RMB.png" style="width: 100%; max-width: 21px;" /> menu (although this can be disabled from the <a href="../Setting_Up_And_Version_Information/IDE_Preferences/Asset_Browser_Preferences.htm">Asset Browser Preferences</a>) and note that you can use <img alt="Shift Key Icon" class="icon" src="../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_Shift.png" style="width: 100%; max-width: 55px;" /> or <img alt="CTRL Key Icon" class="icon" src="../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_Ctrl.png" style="width: 100%; max-width: 55px;" /> / <img alt="CMD Key Icon" class="icon" src="../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_Cmd.png" style="width: 100%; max-width: 55px;" /> along with the left mouse button <img alt="LMB Icon" class="icon" src="../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_LMB.png" style="width: 100%; max-width: 21px;" /> to select multiple assets and assign the colour to all of them at once:</p>
    <p class="dropspot"><img alt="Colour Assets" class="center" src="../assets/Images/Introduction/QS_AssetBrowser_ColourAsset.gif" style="width: 100%; max-width: 440px;" /></p>
    <p class="dropspot">How you colour things is up to you - it can be by asset type, or by use, or by any other criteria!</p>
    <p class="dropspot">One final thing to note with the asset list is that you can select folders and assets then click <img alt="LMB Icon" class="icon" src="../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_LMB.png" style="width: 100%; max-width: 21px;" /> and drag them to move them out of - or into - any other folder group in the asset list, and you can also delete any or all of the folder groups if they are not required, keeping the assset list tidy and only showing the required elements for the project.</p>

  <h1>Tags</h1>
  <p>As mentioned in various of the sections above, the asset browser gives you the ability to add tags to individual assets as well as to group folders. Tags are a very powerful tool, not only for organising and filtering the assets listed in the asset browser, but also when programming your game in general, as you can use assigned tags in code.</p>
  <p>To create a tag you need to use the RMB <img alt="Icon RMB" class="icon" src="../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_RMB.png" style="width: 100%; max-width: 21px;" /> menu on either a folder group or an asset and then select the <em>Edit Tag</em> option. This will bring up the <strong>Tag Editor</strong> where you can type in the tag you want to use, and then press to apply it:</p>
  <p><img alt="The Tag Editor" class="center" src="../assets/Images/Introduction/QS_AssetBrowser_EditTags.gif" style="width: 100%; max-width: 366px;" />You can assign multiple tags to a single item, and you can also use <img alt="Shift Key Icon" class="icon" src="../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_Shift.png" style="width: 100%; max-width: 55px;" /> or <img alt="CTRL Key Icon" class="icon" src="../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_Ctrl.png" style="width: 100%; max-width: 55px;" /> / <img alt="CMD Key Icon" class="icon" src="../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_Cmd.png" style="width: 100%; max-width: 55px;" /> along with the left mouse button <img alt="LMB Icon" class="icon" src="../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_LMB.png" style="width: 100%; max-width: 21px;" /> to select multiple assets and assign a tag to all of them at once. You can also add a tag to a folder group, which will apply it to all the assets within the folder. Once added, all tags will be visible under the Quick Access menu and also in the Filter options (as explained in the sections above), and so can be used to quickly filter the asset list and show only those items with the chosen tag or tags.</p>
  <p>It is important to note that assets that are created while tags are part of the active filter <strong>will be given those tags automatically</strong>. This means that if you are viewing all assets under the "Level 1" tag - for example - all new assets created with this filter active will also have the "Level 1" tag added to them upon creation.</p>
  <p>Finally, tags can also be used in your project code to identify any asset and then act on it, making it a very powerful tool as you can code behaviours based on a tag or group of tags. For example, imagine you have a project with a " <span class="inline">Die On Touch</span>" tag. When programming the project, you can check this tag and code functionality that is appropriate, then later the artists and level designers can create new assets of any type and tag them with the " <span class="inline">Die On Touch</span>" tag then use the asset when designing a level. Any code that has been programmed already to use this tag will automatically include these new assets.</p>
  <p>For more information on using tags in the project code, please see the section on <a href="../GameMaker_Language/GML_Reference/Asset_Management/Assets_And_Tags/Assets_And_Tags.htm">Assets And Tags</a>.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p> </p>
  <h1>RMB Menu</h1>
  <p>When working with the Asset Browser, you can use the right mouse button <img alt="Icon RMB" class="icon" src="../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_RMB.png" style="width: 100%; max-width: 21px;" /> on any resource or folder to open a menu of options:</p>
  <p><img alt="Asset Browser RMB Menu" class="center" src="../assets/Images/Introduction/QS_RMBMenu.png" style="width: 100%; max-width: 272px;" />The exact options available to you will depend on the context that has been clicked, and below we show the contents when the menu is opened on an asset or folder group in the Asset List (other contexts will show some of these but not all):</p>
  <ul class="colour">
    <li><strong>Create </strong>- Create a new asset. On selecting this you will be presented with a list of the available asset types that can be created for you to select one. Note that if you open this menu on a specific asset, there will be an additional option to create a resource if the same type listed just below so you don't have to look for the asset type in the list.</li>
    <li><strong>Edit (All) </strong>- Open the resource properties editor for the selected asset(s) or folder group (note that you can double click <img alt="Icon LMB" class="icon" src="../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_LMB.png" style="width: 100%; max-width: 21px;" /> on a single asset too to open it for it editing).</li>
    <li><strong>Edit Tags</strong> - This will open the Tag editor where you can add or remove tags to the selected asset(s) or folder group(s).</li>
    <li><strong>Rename </strong>- Rename the asset or the folder group.</li>
    <li><strong>Duplicate </strong>- Create a duplicate of the asset or assets that have been selected.</li>
    <li><strong>Favourite </strong>- Flag an asset or assets as being a favourite, adding it to the Quick Access section at the top of the Asset browser.</li>
    <li><strong>Add Existing</strong> - Add existing assets from a different GameMaker Studio 2 project folder. Please note that assets created using a version anterior to 2.3.0 will require conversion as the project file format changed with the 2.3.0 update. This means it may be preferable to import the entire project and converting everything then saving it to a new location if the assets are imported frequently into other projects.</li>
    <li><strong>Add Existing From My Library</strong> - Add assets to the asset list from an item in your Marketplace library. Please note that Marketplace assets created using a version anterior to 2.3.0 will require conversion as the project file format changed with the 2.3.0 update.</li>
    <li><strong>Delete </strong>- Delete the selected asset(s) from the project. This cannot be undone!</li>
    <li><strong>Create Group</strong> - Add a new folder group to the asset list.</li>

  <h1>Asset Types</h1>
  <p>Now you know how the Asset Browser works, you should get to know the different types of asset that you can add to it. Below we give an overview of each of the different asset types available for you to use in your projects:</p>

You can then get the interpolated value by checking any point along the line. In graphics, linear interpolation refers to a basic method of smoothing pixel edges.">linear interpolation</a> or <a class="tooltip" title="This is a type of non-linear interpolation based on mathematical splines. It is used to estimate a new value by connecting two adjacent known values using 'smooth' curves (splines), and a new value can be derived from any point along the line.">catmull-rom interpolation</a> to go between values in the curve. The values you set can be between -1 and 1 on the vertical axis and the duration along the horizontal axis is always normalised form 0 to 1, making it easy to target different time ranges using multipliers in your game code. Animation curves are comprised of "channels" and each channel can have its own curve settings, which permits you to - for example - describe a spacial position with two channels for the x/y position, or a colour gradient with 4 channels to represent a colour format. Animation curve assets can be used when working with sequences and can also be accessed using code, making them a powerful tool when creating your games.</p>

  <div class="droptext" data-targetname="drop_down14">
    <p class="dropspot">Objects are a special resource that we use to control aspects of a game and to do specific things. Most of the time they have <a class="tooltip" title="スプライトとは、1つの大きなシーンの部品となるビットマップ画像です。静止画、動画のどちらも該当します。">sprites</a> associated with them so that you see them in the game room, but sometimes they are used as a "behind the scenes" controller to do things related to the user or for timing, etc... They can be given behaviours and they can react to certain events as well as to each other, and most of the things you see in a game are based on objects and their interactions. Note that we say "based on" because you don't actually place objects directly into the game room, but rather you place <strong>instances </strong>of these objects, which are basically copies (or clones if you prefer) of the object resource. This is a very important thing to remember as instances and objects are not the same thing and each have their own set of functions that can affect them.</p>
    <p class="dropspot">All objects have a set of properties which you can specify in the object editor, like the sprite, whether it uses <a class="tooltip" title="In GameMaker, when we talk about an object, instance or room using 'physics' we mean it is using the built-in physics simulation functions, based on the Box2D physics library.">physics</a> or not, or whether it is a "child" object of another one. They also have a series of built-in variables that can then be used in actions, scripts and code. These built-in variables are used to define the position of the instance when placed in the game room, the animation speed, the direction of movement and a whole host of other things. To control how the object behaves over time, each game frame is split into a series of events, so you can add code or actions into a specific event and it will only run when the event is triggered, and events can be triggered by things like mouse button presses or collisions with other instances.</p>
    <p class="dropspot">Objects are in a very real sense the building blocks of your game, and together with rooms will form the core of any project that you create.</p>
    <p class="dropspot">The RMB <img alt="Icon RMB" class="icon" src="../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_RMB.png" style="width: 100%; max-width: 21px;" /> menu for objects contains the following option (as well as those listed further up this page):</p>

  <div class="droptext" data-targetname="drop_down18">
    <p class="dropspot">At some point while creating your games you may need an instance of one of your objects to follow a path through a level. Now, this can be done by simply creating an array of positions within the room and then having the instance move between them, but that can be a chore to set up and is difficult to change, test and adapt for different things. That is when you'd want to create a path resource.</p>
    <p class="dropspot">The basic idea of the path resource is rather simple - you define a path by drawing it in the path editor, then you can place an action (or code) in an event of an object to tell the object to follow that particular path in the game room. You can set the speed to follow the path and a number of other actions relating to the position and orientation of the path within the room too.</p>

  <div class="droptext" data-targetname="drop_down19">
    <p class="dropspot">All games that you make in GameMaker Studio 2 need at least one room to run (but can have many, many more) , and a room is basically a space where you place instances of the objects that make up your game and where the action of the game will take place. However the Room Editor is one of the most powerful of resources available to you, since it permits you to not only add instances of objects, but to set up the "view" into the game room, add the backgrounds and tiles that are drawn to create the game world, create extra special effects that are independent of the object/instance system, and as well as run code independently of an object. Rooms can also be set to <strong>inherit </strong>properties from other rooms, meaning that you can create a single room with a load of tiles, for example, and then make another room that inherits these tiles, so that you don't have to re-create them again.</p>

    <p class="dropspot">A script resource is simply a container for one or more functions you have written. For example, say you want to have all your enemy objects create a number of different instances when they die - like some gold, an explosion and some blood as well as play a sound. Now you could add all the required code into each object that requires it, but in general you'd be better off creating a single function in script resource and then calling that. This means that you only have to add one line of code into the objects to call this new scripted function, and if you wish to change something you only need to change it once in the script and all the objects will automatically run the new code, rather than have to go through every object and change the same thing in multiple places.</p>

    <p class="dropspot">A sequence asset is essentially a collection of other resources that perform a dynamic animation over time. They can contain sprites, instances, sounds and other things, and each of these can be set to move or change colour, or start/stop over time within the sequence itself by assigning the assets to specific <strong>tracks </strong>within the sequence. These tracks can then have different attributes applied to them which can be static or change over time. All editing of a sequence takes place in the <strong>Sequence Editor</strong> which is comprised of:</p>

      <li class="dropspot">the <strong>Canvas </strong>- where you place the assets that make up the sequence </li>

    <p class="dropspot">Shaders are a very powerful tool that can be used to manipulate the graphics that your game renders to the screen, permitting incredibly fast effects that can range from, for example, adding a subtle colour hue to a sprite, right up to full screen distortion effects. Basically it's a two-part program that runs directly on the graphics card itself, making it very fast since the GPU is doing all the work and freeing up CPU cycles for your game code. The full shader is comprised of a vertex shader program, and a fragment shader program (also known as a pixel shader). Both of these tiny programs work together in order to manipulate what the graphics card renders to the screen. This then permits you to manipulate in real time the position, colour, and alpha values that are actually rendered into the display buffer.</p>

    <p class="dropspot">Tile sets are taken from the sprite resources, but are classified as a separate resource since GameMaker Studio 2 will handle them differently when creating your game. Basically a tile set is a single image that GameMaker Studio 2 will break into separate sections based on the values you give for the various settings. You can then use these in the room editor (or procedurally through code) to generate a tile map in your room. They are great for designing any static items in your room, like terrain, walls, backdrops, etc... as they don't have the same overhead that objects have.</p>
    <p class="dropspot"><img alt="Example Tileset" class="center" src="../assets/Images/Introduction/QS_Tileset.png" style="width: 100%; max-width: 768px;" /> Above is an example sprite that would be used as a tile set to create walls. As you can see, it can be "split" into 64x64pixel chunks, which would then placed into the room editor.</p>
    <div class="dropspotnote">NOTE: Tiles are always square, so if you need anything other than that, you should be using an instance with a sprite or an asset layer in the room editor.</div>
    <p class="dropspot">The RMB <img alt="Icon RMB" class="icon" src="../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_RMB.png" style="width: 100%; max-width: 21px;" /> menu for tilesets contains the following option (as well as those listed further down this page):</p>
    <ul class="dropspotlist">
      <li class="dropspot"><strong>Assign Texture Group</strong> - When you select this option, you will be presented with a list of the available texture groups, and you can then choose one to add the tileset to or create a new one, if required. If multiple tilesets are selected in the Asset Browser - or you have selected a group folder of tilesets - then all of them will be added to the chosen texture group. See <a href="../Settings/Texture_Groups.htm">here</a> for more information on texture groups.</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="dropspot">In most games you will want certain things to happen at certain moments in time. Now, you can try to achieve this by using the <em>Alarm Events</em> in an instance, but when things get too complicated this won't work any more, especially as you are limited to only twelve alarms. That's why we have the timeline resource. In a timeline you specify which actions must happen at any specific moment in game time, and you can use all the actions that are available for an object in its different events as well as code. Once you create a time line you can then assign it to an object, and the instance of that object will then execute the actions and code at the indicated moments of time when placed or created within a room.</p>
