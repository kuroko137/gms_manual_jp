Write_Buffer.htm+html.body.p:87-3,"This action can be used to write data to a buffer. You supply the unique buffer ID to write to (as returned by the action <a href=""Create_Buffer.htm"">Create Buffer</a>) and then the value to write, which can be either a real or a string, but note that <b>all values are stored as strings</b> so when you read from the buffer (using <a href=""Read_Buffer.htm"">Read Buffer</a>) you may need to use one of the <a href=""../Data_Types/Data_Type_Actions.htm"">Data Type Actions</a> to convert it from a string back to the original value. Keep in mind too that buffers are read and written to <i>sequentially</i> and so writing to a buffer will move the ""seek"" position along one, meaning that to write various pieces of data you simply call this action the number of times required."
