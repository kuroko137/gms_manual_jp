Delete_File.htm+html.body.p:107-3,"The above action block code will check to see if the file ""checkpoint.sav"" exists, and if it does it then checks to see if the file ""checkpoint_OLD.sav"" exists. If that file exists as well, then it is deleted, and then the original ""checkpoint.sav"" file is renamed to ""checkpoint_OLD.sav"". Finally a buffer is saved as ""checkpoint.sav"" (essentially we are backing up a saved buffer file each time we save it, so that there is always a ""current"" save and an ""old"" save file)."
