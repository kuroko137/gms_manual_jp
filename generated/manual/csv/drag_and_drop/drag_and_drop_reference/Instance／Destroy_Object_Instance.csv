Destroy_Object_Instance.htm+html.body.p:87-3,"You can call this action whenever you wish to ""destroy"" an instance, which will remove it from the room. You should note that when you destroy an instance, its <a href=""../../../The_Asset_Editors/Object_Properties/Object_Events.htm"">Destroy Event</a> is called <i>immediately after the action that calls the destroy</i>. Also note that although the Destroy Event is performed the instant that the action is called, the instance is <i>not</i> immediately removed from the game, and it will continue to perform the code contained in the current event until the end, and only when the current event is over will the instance be removed from the game, at which time the <a href=""../../../The_Asset_Editors/Object_Properties/Object_Events.htm"">Clean Up Event</a> will be called."
