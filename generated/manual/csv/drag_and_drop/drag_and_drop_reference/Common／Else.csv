Else.htm+html.body.p:87-3,"The ""else"" action is <i>only ever used in conjunction with <a href=""If_Variable.htm"">If Variable</a></i> (or any other ""if"" action), and is a way of defining a set of actions that should be performed if the ""if"" evaluation returns <tt>false</tt>. For example, you could have an ""if"" action that checks if the players health variable is less than or equal to 0, and if that evaluates to true you destroy the instance. However if you want to perform a different set of code actions if the player health is <i>not</i> less than 0 then you can add an ""else"" in and then specify the actions to be performed while the if evaluates to <tt>false</tt>."
