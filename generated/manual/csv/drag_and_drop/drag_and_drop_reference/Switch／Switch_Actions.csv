Switch_Actions.htm+html.body.p:87-3,"The <b>Switches</b> action library contains those actions that are required for creating switch statements in your game action code. In a number of situations you want to let your instances complete an action depending on a particular value, and while you can do this using a number of consecutive ""if"" statements, this can get messy when the possible choices gets above two or three. In these cases it is better to use the ""switch"" action. A switch action works as follows:"
Switch_Actions.htm+html.body.ul.li:91-5,You supply value a (usually from some kind of expression or variable)
Switch_Actions.htm+html.body.ul.li:92-5,"The value is compared with the value assigned to the various ""case"" statements"
Switch_Actions.htm+html.body.ul.li:93-5,"If the value is the same as the case value, the contents of the case are performed otherwise the next case is evaluated, etc..."
Switch_Actions.htm+html.body.ul.li:94-5,"Once a case has been performed <i>or</i> all cases have been evaluated and failed, the code will continue from the end of the switch"
Switch_Actions.htm+html.body.ul.li:95-5,"If all cases failed and you have a default case, then that will be performed before the code continues from the end of the switch"
