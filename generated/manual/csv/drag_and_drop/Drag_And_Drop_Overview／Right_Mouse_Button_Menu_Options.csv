Right_Mouse_Button_Menu_Options.htm+html.body.ul.li:92-5,"<strong>Cut </strong>/ <strong>Copy </strong>/ <strong>Paste</strong>: This will permit you cut, copy or paste any action that is selected in the workspace. Note that you can use <img alt=""{IMG_TXT} Shift Icon"" class=""icon"" src=""../../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_Shift.png"" style=""width: 100%; max-width: 55px;"" /> + <img alt=""{IMG_TXT} LMB Icon"" class=""icon"" src=""../../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_LMB.png"" style=""width: 100%; max-width: 21px;"" /> outside of the actions and drag, or use <img alt=""{IMG_TXT} Control Icon"" class=""icon"" src=""../../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_Ctrl.png"" style=""width: 100%; max-width: 55px;"" /> / <img alt=""{IMG_TXT} CMD Icon"" class=""icon"" src=""../../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_Cmd.png"" style=""width: 100%; max-width: 55px;"" /> + <img alt=""{IMG_TXT} LMB Icon"" class=""icon"" src=""../../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_LMB.png"" style=""width: 100%; max-width: 21px;"" /> on individual actions, to select more than one and apply the command to all of them."
Right_Mouse_Button_Menu_Options.htm+html.body.ul.li:94-5,"<strong>Comment </strong>/ <strong>Remove Comment</strong>: This option permits you to add and remove comments from your DnD™ code blocks. When you select Comment, text editor will be opened to the right of the selected DnD™ block, and there you can add any text you require, whether it be a reminder to change something, or a helpful comment for a tutorial, or even instructions for your teammates:<br /> <img alt=""{IMG_TXT} DnD™ Comments"" class=""center"" src=""../../assets/Images/Scripting_Reference/Drag_And_Drop/Overview/DnD_Add_Comment.gif"" style=""width: 100%; max-width: 621px;"" />Once you have added the comment, you can click on it and drag it to position it vertically and horizontally - although only to the right of the parent node - and collapsing the DnD™ node will also collapse the comment and show a summary of its contents (in which case it cannot be repositioned). If the comment is no longer required, then you can either delete all the text in the comment, or use the <strong>Remove Comment </strong>option from the menu. Note that when you copy a node, the comment will be copied along with it, and if you convert the node from DnD™ to GML, then the comment will be preserved and added to the GML that is created, as illustrated in the image below:<br /> <img alt=""{IMG_TXT} DnD™ Comments In GML"" class=""center"" src=""../../assets/Images/Scripting_Reference/Drag_And_Drop/Overview/DnD_Comments_In_GML.png"" style=""width: 100%; max-width: 695px;"" />As mentioned above, a comment can only be applied to a single node, but you can expand it to cover multiple nodes by simply adding in line breaks to extend it - although this may require you to re-position the comment to prevent overlaps with subsequent nodes:<br /> <img alt=""{IMG_TXT} DnD™ Comment Over Multiple Nodes"" class=""center"" src=""../../assets/Images/Scripting_Reference/Drag_And_Drop/Overview/DnD_Comments_Extended.png"" style=""width: 100%; max-width: 664px;"" />Once a comment has been added, you can select the ""<strong>Comment</strong>"" option again from the RMB menu or you can double click <img alt=""{IMG_TXT} LMB Icon"" class=""icon"" src=""../../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_LMB.png"" style=""width: 100%; max-width: 21px;"" /> on it to enable editing."
Right_Mouse_Button_Menu_Options.htm+html.body.ul.li:104-5,"<strong>Disable </strong>/ <strong>Enable</strong>: These commands can be used disable or enable the action (or actions) selected. When an action is disabled, it is still visible in the workspace but it will not run when you compile the game. In this way you can add/remove actions for testing and debugging. The image below shows some DnD™ code with actions disabled:<br /> <img alt=""{IMG_TXT} DnD™ Disable Actions"" class=""center"" src=""../../assets/Images/Scripting_Reference/Drag_And_Drop/Overview/DnD_Disable_Actions.png"" style=""width: 100%; max-width: 440px;"" />You can see that the actions ""If Score"" and ""Go To Next Room"" have been disabled - they have been grayed out, visually - and so they will be skipped when the game is tested or compiled."
Right_Mouse_Button_Menu_Options.htm+html.body.ul.li:108-5,"<strong>Toggle Breakpoint</strong>: This command will toggle a breakpoint on or off for the selected action. A breakpoint is simply a point in the DnD™ code where the <a href=""../../IDE_Tools/The_Debugger.htm"">debugger</a> should stop when the game is being run in Debug Mode. An action with a breakpoint assigned to it will be highlighted, as shown in the image below (the ""If Health"" action has been set as a breakpoint):"

Right_Mouse_Button_Menu_Options.htm+html.body.ul.li:112-5,"<strong>Collapse All</strong> / <strong>Expand All</strong>: DnD™ actions can be either collapsed or expanded, where a collapsed action will simply show the name of the action but not any of the internal values thus maximising the available space for the workspace. For example:<br /> <img alt=""{IMG_TXT} DnD™ Collapsed Actions"" class=""center"" src=""../../assets/Images/Scripting_Reference/Drag_And_Drop/Overview/DnD_CollapseActions.png"" style=""width: 100%; max-width: 558px;"" />As you can see, the actions take up much less space, and you can still see what they do from the short description given to the right. You can select the ""Expand All"" option to undo this for every node in the workspace."
Right_Mouse_Button_Menu_Options.htm+html.body.ul.li:116-5,"<strong>Reset Layout</strong>: This will reset the DnD™ workspace, setting the zoom level to 100%, focusing on the currently selected action, and expanding any (and all) collapsed actions too."
Right_Mouse_Button_Menu_Options.htm+html.body.ul.li:117-5,"<strong>Live Preview</strong>: When you select this option, you will enable or disable the DnD™ to GML (GameMaker Language) code preview window.

Right_Mouse_Button_Menu_Options.htm+html.body.ul.li:118-5,"<strong>Convert To GML</strong>: This will convert all your actions in the current event to GML (GameMaker Language) code. Be very careful with this as <em>you cannot convert GML back into the DnD™ actions that it was created from</em>. You can convert the event back to a DnD™ event from code, but any code will simply be wrapped in an <a href=""../Drag_And_Drop_Reference/Common/Execute_Code.htm"">Execute Code</a> action. This is explained in more detail on the page <a href=""Changing_DnD_To_Code.htm"">Changing DnD™ To Code</a>."
