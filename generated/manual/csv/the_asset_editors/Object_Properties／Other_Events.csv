Other_Events.htm+html.body.p:88-3,This page explains each of the different events that are collected under the <strong>Other</strong> events category in the Object Editor:
Other_Events.htm+html.body.p:90-3,"<span data-open-text=""true"">Outside Room</span><span data-close-text=""true"">Outside Room</span>"
Other_Events.htm+html.body.div.p:92-5,"This event is triggered when an instance goes outside the room, and is based on a check done against the assigned sprite (and its properties) of the instance, so that even if you have set the image x or y scale to a value other than one, this event will only be triggered when the whole sprite would be out the screen. If the instance has no sprite, then the position of the instance is used and the moment its x or y position is outside of the room then it will trigger the event too. This event is typically used for things like bullets, where they are destroyed once they leave the room so you don't end up with millions of bullets flying away infinitely and causing your game to slow down. Note that this event is only triggered once when the instance leaves the room initially."
Other_Events.htm+html.body.p:98-3,"<span data-open-text=""true"">Intersect Boundary</span><span data-close-text=""true"">Intersect Boundary</span>"
Other_Events.htm+html.body.div.p:100-5,"This event is triggered when an instance ""touches"" the inside edge of the room, and, like the outside room event, is based on a check done against the assigned sprite of the instance, so that even if you have set the image x or y scale to a value other than one, this event still be triggered the moment a part of the sprite intersects the room boundary. If the instance has <em>no </em>sprite, then the position of the instance is used and the moment its x or y position intersects the room boundary then it will trigger the event too. You can use this event to do things like tell an instance to ""bounce"" back in towards the room again rather than go outside."
Other_Events.htm+html.body.p:105-3,"<span data-open-text=""true"">Views</span><span data-close-text=""true"">Views</span>"
Other_Events.htm+html.body.div.p:107-5,"Camera views are normally defined in the room editor and used to show only a small area of a large room at any one time. This event category has two seperate sub-categories (<strong>Outside View</strong> and <strong>Intersect Boundary</strong>), with eight different events in each corresponding to the eight available view ports. These two categories function exactly the same as the respective room events, only taking the boundary of the camera view as the thing for the instance to check against rather than the room."
Other_Events.htm+html.body.p:112-3,"<span data-open-text=""true"">Game Start</span><span data-close-text=""true"">Game Start</span>"
Other_Events.htm+html.body.div.p:114-5,"This special event is triggered only once in the whole game and only for those instances with actions or code placed in the event. These instances must be present in the first room of the game and have been placed there in the room editor, rather than have been created dynamically using code or actions. It should be noted that this event happens <em>after </em>the create event of all instances and so can contain code or actions with variables that have been previously defined in that event. This event is typically defined in only one ""controller"" object and is typically used to initialize global variables, start music, read from files and any other thing that is usually only done once at the start of a game."
Other_Events.htm+html.body.p:119-3,"<span data-open-text=""true"">Game End</span><span data-close-text=""true"">Game End</span>"
Other_Events.htm+html.body.div.p:121-5,"Similar to the above mentioned Game Start event, this event is only triggered once in the whole game and that is just before the game window actually closes. Again, for an instance with this event to actually do anything it has to be in the room as the game is closed. Please note that this event in really only viable for <strong>Windows</strong>, <strong>Ubuntu </strong>(Linux) and <strong>macOS</strong> games as mobile devices may just close the game without giving GameMaker Studio 2 the chance to call this event. For browser games made with the HTML5 module, this event should work when the game tab or browser is closed, but not all browsers support this feature (Firefox, Chrome and Safari do at the time of writing) so care must be taken when using it. Typically you would use this event to save data."
Other_Events.htm+html.body.p:127-3,"<span data-open-text=""true"">Room Start</span><span data-close-text=""true"">Room Start</span>"
Other_Events.htm+html.body.div.p:129-5,This event happens for all instances initially in a room when the room starts. Please note that it happens <em>after </em>the creation event and so can depend on variables and things defined previously in that event.
Other_Events.htm+html.body.p:132-3,"<span data-open-text=""true"">Room End</span><span data-close-text=""true"">Room End</span>"
Other_Events.htm+html.body.div.p:134-5,"This event happens to all instances that are in the room when the room ends. This event is very useful for ""cleaning up"" after a level has ended, for example you can delete loaded resources here, or remove a particle system to prevent memory leaks etc..."
Other_Events.htm+html.body.p:138-3,"<span data-open-text=""true"">Animation End</span><span data-close-text=""true"">Animation End</span>"
Other_Events.htm+html.body.div.p:140-5,"In GameMaker Studio 2 sprites are not static things as they can have sub-images and be animated at different speeds. Each frame of an animation (called a sub-image) has its own number, starting at 0, which can be checked in code or through actions, but sometimes all you really need to know is when the animation has ended. That's when this event is triggered, right at the end of the animation when the sub image index shows that the last frame has been reached. This event is really useful for many things, for example an explosion object where you can set the instance to destroy itself when the last frame of the animation is reached."
Other_Events.htm+html.body.p:145-3,"<span data-open-text=""true"">Animation Update</span><span data-close-text=""true"">Animation Update</span>"
Other_Events.htm+html.body.div.p:147-5,"This event is designed only for use with the <a href=""../../GameMaker_Language/GML_Reference/Asset_Management/Sprites/Skeletal_Animation/Skeletal_Animation.htm"">Skeletal Animation Functions</a>. It is a special event that is triggered every step in an instance that uses a skeletal animation sprite, and is designed to ""intercept"" the bone data after the orientation of the bones has been calculated for the current animation state but before this data is committed to use for drawing. This allows you to make modifications to the bone data using the appropriate functions."
Other_Events.htm+html.body.p:152-3,"<span data-open-text=""true"">Animation Event</span><span data-close-text=""true"">Animation Event</span>"
Other_Events.htm+html.body.div.p:154-5,"This event is designed only for use with the <a href=""../../GameMaker_Language/GML_Reference/Asset_Management/Sprites/Skeletal_Animation/Skeletal_Animation.htm"">Skeletal Animation Functions</a>. This event is triggered in an object which has a skeletal animation sprite assigned to it, and where the object is using the default draw for the assigned sprite, or the sprite is being drawn via draw_self(). It currently won't trigger on skeleton animation sprites drawn any other way. The event is designed to capture and transmit data that has been assigned to particular events in the sprite animation as defined in the editor used to make them."
Other_Events.htm+html.body.div.p:157-5,"When the Animation Event is triggered, a special <a href=""../../GameMaker_Language/GML_Reference/Data_Structures/DS_Maps/DS_Maps.htm"">DS Map</a> will be created called the event_data map (much the same as we have the async_load map for an async event). This map will have all of the following key/value pairs that you can parse to get information about the event:"
Other_Events.htm+html.body.div.ul.li:160-7,"""<span class=""inline"">name</span>"": the name of the event (as defined in the animation program)"
Other_Events.htm+html.body.div.ul.li:161-7,"""<span class=""inline"">track</span>"": the index of the track the animation is playing on (default is 0)"
Other_Events.htm+html.body.div.ul.li:162-7,"""<span class=""inline"">integer</span>"": an integer value associated with the event (as defined in the animation program, default is 0)"
Other_Events.htm+html.body.div.ul.li:163-7,"""<span class=""inline"">float</span>"": a float value associated with the event (as defined in the animation program, default is 0.0)"
Other_Events.htm+html.body.div.ul.li:164-7,"""<span class=""inline"">string</span>"": a string value associated with the event (as defined in the animation program, default is an empty string """")"
Other_Events.htm+html.body.p:169-3,"<span data-open-text=""true"">Path Ended</span><span data-close-text=""true"">Path Ended</span>"
Other_Events.htm+html.body.div.p:171-5,"<a href=""../Paths.htm"">Paths</a> can be an important part of making any game, whether it is for a tower defence type game, or a shoot-em-up or whatever, and it's often really important that an instance does some particular action when it reaches the end of its path. This event detects this and is triggered when it happens allowing you to add in code or actions to deal with the circumstances, for example in a tower defence game you would use this to destroy the instance and remove a health point from the goal object."
Other_Events.htm+html.body.p:176-3,"<span data-open-text=""true"">User Events</span><span data-close-text=""true"">User Events</span>"
Other_Events.htm+html.body.div.p:178-5,"These are special events that are not triggered by GameMaker Studio 2 automatically, but have to be <em>implicitly </em>called by you using code or actions while the game is running. There are 12 user events in total and they can contain code or actions and they can be called at any time in the game loop, making them very useful for creating your own events that happen when <em>you </em>decide."
