Image_Loaded.htm+html.body.p.img[alt]:87-6,{IMG_TXT} Image Loaded Event
Image_Loaded.htm+html.body.p:87-3,"This event is triggered when you load an image into GameMaker Studio 2, as long as you have used a valid <a class=""tooltip"" title=""TITLE_KEY::URL"">URL</a> or <a href=""../../../Settings/Included_Files.htm"">included file</a> path with the applicable load file function. For example say you want to load a sprite image, and only change the current sprite for the instance to the new one when it has loaded. Well you would have something like this in a create event or an alarm event (for example):"
Image_Loaded.htm+html.body.p:89-3,"{ANY_CODE} var _url ={nbsp_x1}""http://www.angusgames.com/game/background1.png"";<br /> spr = sprite_add(_url, 0, false, false, 0, 0);"
Image_Loaded.htm+html.body.p:90-3,"This will now start to load the image into the device or the browser, but it will not block GameMaker Studio 2 while it waits for the file to be loaded. Instead GameMaker Studio 2 will keep running as normal until the image is loaded and the <a class=""tooltip"" title=""TITLE_KEY::callback"">callback</a> triggers the <strong>Image Loaded Event</strong>, where a <a href=""../../../GameMaker_Language/GML_Reference/Data_Structures/DS_Maps/DS_Maps.htm"">DS Map</a> is created and stored in the special variable <a href=""../../../GameMaker_Language/GML_Overview/Variables/Builtin_Global_Variables/async_load.htm""><span class=""inline"">async_load</span></a>. The map contains the following information:"
Image_Loaded.htm+html.body.ul.li:93-5,"""<span class=""inline"">filename</span>"": The complete path to the file you requested."
Image_Loaded.htm+html.body.ul.li:94-5,"""<span class=""inline"">id</span>"": The ID of the resource that you have loaded. This will be the same as the variable that you have assigned the resource to."
Image_Loaded.htm+html.body.ul.li:95-5,"""<span class=""inline"">status</span>"": Returns a value of less than 0 for an error."
Image_Loaded.htm+html.body.p:97-3,You would then assign the newly loaded image to a sprite in this event. The following code example demonstrates how the returned information would be used:
Image_Loaded.htm+html.body.p:98-3,"{ANY_CODE} if ds_map_find_value(async_load, ""id"") == spr<br /> {nbsp_x1} {nbsp_x1}{<br /> {nbsp_x1} {nbsp_x1}if ds_map_find_value(async_load, ""status"") &gt;= 0<br /> {nbsp_x1} {nbsp_x1} {nbsp_x1} {<br /> {nbsp_x1} {nbsp_x1} {nbsp_x1} sprite_index = spr<br /> {nbsp_x1} {nbsp_x1} {nbsp_x1} }<br /> {nbsp_x1} {nbsp_x1}}"
Image_Loaded.htm+html.body.p:99-3,"The above code will first check the <span class=""inline"">id</span> of the DS map that has been created, then check the <span class=""inline"">status</span> of the callback. If the value is greater than or equal to 0 (signalling success) the result from the callback will then be used to set the sprite index to the newly loaded image."
