Layer_Properties.htm+html.body.p:87-3,"Everything that goes into the room you create in the <a href=""../Rooms.htm"">Room Editor</a> is placed on a <strong>layer</strong>. Layers can be added, removed, and sorted from the Layers Editor, and come in a variety of different types, each with their own set of options and way of working. You aren't limited to the number of each type of layer, and can have multiple tile layers, or path layers, or instance layers, etc... Each type of layer has it's own <strong>properties window</strong> where you can set different things depending on the layer type. You can also toggle the layers visibility, with invisible layers <em>not </em>being processed at runtime (but you can make them visible again at any time using the appropriate <a href=""../../GameMaker_Language/GML_Reference/Asset_Management/Rooms/General_Layer_Functions/layer_set_visible.htm"">layer function</a>).","<a href=""../Rooms.htm"">ルームエディタ</a>で作成したものはすべて<strong>レイヤー</strong>に置かれます。レイヤーは、レイヤーエディタから追加・削除や整理ができ、さまざまな種類があるだけでなく、それぞれに専用の設定や仕組みがあります。レイヤーの数に上限はなく、タイルレイヤー、パスレイヤー、インスタンスレイヤーといったさまざまなレイヤーを追加できます。レイヤーには種類ごとに専用の<strong>プロパティウィンドウ</strong>があり、レイヤーの種類によって設定できる内容は異なります。レイヤーは表示を切り替えることも可能で、非表示にしたレイヤーは実行時に<em>処理されなくなります</em>（ただし対応する<a href=""../../GameMaker_Language/GML_Reference/Asset_Management/Rooms/General_Layer_Functions/layer_set_visible.htm"">レイヤー関数</a>によっていつでも再表示できます）。"

If the room has inherited layers from a parent room, you can toggle the inheritance from the button at the bottom, but note that this will affect all layers (see <a href=""Room_Inheritance.htm"">here</a> for more information on inheritance). You can also use <img_tag=Shift_Icon:0> or <img_tag=Control_Icon:0> / <img_tag=CMD_Icon:0> and left click <img_tag=LMB_Icon:0> on multiple layers to select them for duplication or deletion (these options are also available from the right mouse <img_tag=RMB_Icon:0> Menu).","上記の画像はレイヤーエディタです。上側はレイヤーの一覧で、その下にはレイヤーの作成ボタンがあります。レイヤーの名前はこのエディタに表示されている名前をゆっくりダブルクリックすると変更でき（英数字および""_""記号のみ受け付けます）、目アイコン<img_tag=Eye_Icon:0>をクリックするとレイヤーの表示を切り替えられます。親ルームから継承されたレイヤーがある場合、下のボタンから継承の切り替えができますが、すべてのレイヤーに影響するためご注意ください（継承についての詳細は<a href=""Room_Inheritance.htm"">こちら</a>を参照してください）。また、<img_tag=Shift_Icon:0>か<img_tag=Control_Icon:0> / <img_tag=CMD_Icon:0>を押しながらクリック<img_tag=LMB_Icon:0>で複数のレイヤーを選択し、複製したり削除できます（ボタンだけでなく右クリック<img_tag=RMB_Icon:0>メニューからも同じ操作ができます）。"

Layer_Properties.htm+html.body.div.p:113-5,"When you create a new background layer it is empty by default and so draws the defined background colour. If you do not assign a sprite for the background layer image, this is what will be drawn instead, and you can click the colour box to open the colour picker and change the colour used. If you do choose a sprite, then you can tick the tiling options to tile it horizontally or vertically, or to make it stretch the image to fill the whole room."
Layer_Properties.htm+html.body.div.p:115-5,"If you want to have the background scroll in a direction, you can set the horizontal and/or vertical speed too (each game step it will move along the given access by the number of pixels that you set here), and you can also re-position the background image by setting the x and y offset values. You can also set the animation speed for the background if the sprite resource that you have selected has multiple sub-images, although this is locked by default to the value that you set in the Sprite Editor for the image used. Finally you can set the depth for the layer explicitly, although again by default this is locked and you can simply drag and reorder the layer order in the Layer Editor to change this value."

Layer_Properties.htm+html.body.div.p:125-5,"This window simply shows a list of all the instances that are currently on the layer. You can add more instances to a layer by opening up the <a href=""../../Introduction/The_Asset_Browser.htm"">Asset Browser</a> and then dragging objects from there into the room, or alternatively you can select an instance from the Asset Browser and then press and hold <img_tag=Alt_Icon:0> to preview the resource ""in-situ"", and if you additionally click the left mouse button <img_tag=LMB_Icon:0> you can add the instance and even ""paint"" it into the room layer by maintaining the button pressed and moving the mouse."
Layer_Properties.htm+html.body.div.p:127-5,"The layer list can be ordered by clicking <img_tag=LMB_Icon:0> and dragging an instance in the list to the position required, but it is worth noting that this is purely for organisational purposes within the room editor and if you want to set a specific creation order, please use the <strong>Creation Order Window</strong>, which can be opened from the <a href=""Room_Properties.htm"">Room Properties</a> window, or from the <a href=""../Rooms.htm"">Room context menu</a>."
Layer_Properties.htm+html.body.div.p:129-5,Double-clicking <img_tag=LMB_Icon:0> on any instance - either in the room editor itself or in the properties list - will open a new window to let you modify aspects of that single unique instance:
Layer_Properties.htm+html.body.div.p.img[alt]:131-25,{IMG_TXT} Room Instance properties
Layer_Properties.htm+html.body.div.p:131-5,"By default the instance will have a name like ""<span class=""inline"">inst_38B0BFF</span>"", but this can be changed to anything you want as long as the name uses only alpha-numeric characters and the under-bar ""_"" (and no spaces). However it's worth noting that the name given here (whether it's one you give, or the default one that the IDE gives) is considered a <a class=""tooltip"" title=""TITLE_KEY::constant"">constant</a> and so <strong>must be <em>unique </em>to the instance</strong>. This also means that it can be used in code n your game to identify the instance, but only if you are in the same room as the instance."
Layer_Properties.htm+html.body.div.p:135-5,"Below the instance name you have buttons to set whether the instance is to inherit from the parent room, change the object that you want it to be an instance of or even open up the <a href=""../Objects.htm"">Object Editor</a>, should you wish to change anything there. There is a button to check and edit variables through the <a href=""../Object_Properties/Object_Variables.htm"">Object Variable</a> window and you can change the initial characteristics of this instance too, setting a colour to blend it with (white by default), or rotating and flipping it. You can also scale the instance along either or both the axis, and set its position within the room, as well as the image speed and initial frame for the sprite to use."
Layer_Properties.htm+html.body.div.p:138-5,"Finally you can give the instance some creation code which will run directly after the object creation event code, and is unique to this instance (so you can, say, set a variable in the object which all instance will have then modify it in the creation code so that it's a unique value for one instance). Clicking this will chain a <a href=""../Scripts.htm"">script window</a> to the instance where you can add any functions or modify any variables and this code will be run directly after the instance has been created and the instance <a href=""../Object_Properties/Event_Order.htm"">Create Event</a> has been run. Note that you can toggle inheritance of creation code on or off <em>independently </em>of the instance inheritance."
Layer_Properties.htm+html.body.div.p:141-5,"It is worth noting that each instance on a layer is automatically flagged for exporting when the game is made. However, especially when working with inheritance, it may be that you don't <em>want </em>specific instances to be added to the room in the final game (or you may have a debug instance in every room and simply want to exclude it from the final game). If that is the case, then simply un-checking the ""<strong>Export</strong>"" checkbox to the left of the instance in the list will prevent it from being exported as part of the executable. It is important to note, however, that if you have any code that references the instance, <strong>then the game will not run correctly</strong>, so use this feature with care."

You can click <img_tag=LMB_Icon:0> on any tile to select it as the current <strong>brush </strong>and then draw them to the layer in the room editor by clicking <img_tag=LMB_Icon:0> on the room canvas, or, if you want to draw multiple tiles together you can select them as a group by clicking the left mouse <img_tag=LMB_Icon:0> and dragging to select them from the tileset before drawing.

If you hold down <img_tag=Control_Icon:0> / <img_tag=CMD_Icon:0> + <img_tag=LMB_Icon:0> on different path points, then they will all be selected and you can move them together or delete them all from the menu option (explained below)."
Layer_Properties.htm+html.body.div.p:250-5,If you right click <img_tag=RMB_Icon:0> in the room editor window while manipulating a path then you'll get the following options:
Layer_Properties.htm+html.body.div.p.img[alt]:251-25,{IMG_TXT} Room Layer Path Menu
Layer_Properties.htm+html.body.div.p:251-5,"Here you can reverse the path direction (this will have little visible effect, but reverses the order in which the path points are counted so the start point becomes the end point and vice-versa), as well as flip them horizontally or vertically. You can also delete the selected point from this menu. Note that you can hold down ""<span class=""inline"">T</span>"", "" <span class=""inline"">S</span>"" or ""<span class=""inline"">R</span>"" then click <img_tag=LMB_Icon:0> and drag to translate, scale or rotate the entire path."

Layer_Properties.htm+html.body.div.p.img[alt]:259-25,{IMG_TXT} Room Layer Asset properties
Layer_Properties.htm+html.body.div.p:259-5,"An asset layer is simply a graphical asset (sprite or sequence) that has been placed into the room independently of instances, and you can place them by either dragging them in from the <a href=""../../Introduction/The_Asset_Browser.htm"">Asset Browser</a> or by selecting the one you want in the Asset Browser and then using <img_tag=Alt_Icon:0> + <img_tag=LMB_Icon:0> to ""paint"" them. Sprite assets are similar to tiles, only they can be fully animated - if the sprite used has sub-images they will be shown - without the restrictions that are in place for tiles, ie: they aren't forced to a grid and animations can be any length and speed. Sequences are ""cellections"" of sprites, sounds and instances that will play when the room is entered."
Layer_Properties.htm+html.body.div.p:263-5,"While placing assets on the asset layer they will snap to the grid snap values set at the top of the room editor for the grid, but if you want to place them freehand, simply switch off the grid or use the keys <img_tag=Control_Icon:0> / <img_tag=CMD_Icon:0> and the left mouse button <img_tag=LMB_Icon:0>. While those keys are held down, you will be free to place the asset anywhere, without it snapping to the grid resolution."
Layer_Properties.htm+html.body.div.p:264-5,"Once you place an asset in the room, you have a certain amount of control over how it looks by double clicking <img_tag=LMB_Icon:0> on it to open the asset properties window:"
Layer_Properties.htm+html.body.div.p.img[alt]:265-25,{IMG_TXT} Room Asset properties
Layer_Properties.htm+html.body.div.p:265-5,"From here you can give the asset a unique name, set whether it is to inherit from the parent room, or change the sprite or sequence that you want it to display. For sequeunces, you can set the animation speed and the initial <a class=""tooltip"" title=""TITLE_KEY::playhead"">playhead</a> frame, as well as the colour to blend with it (white by default) and the position in the room. You can change the characteristics of sprite assets too, setting a colour to blend it with (white by default), or rotating and flipping it. You can also scale sprites along either or both the axis, and set their position within the room. If the sprite has sub-images, you can choose the animation speed as well as set the initial frame to be shown."
Layer_Properties.htm+html.body.div.p:269-5,"It is worth noting that each asset on the layer is automatically flagged for exporting when the game is made. However, especially when working with <a href=""Room_Inheritance.htm"">inheritance</a>, it may be that you don't want specific sprites to be added to the room in the final game. If that is the case, then simply un-checking the ""<strong>Export</strong>"" checkbox to the left of the sprite in the layer properties list will prevent it from being exported as part of the executable. It is important to note, however, that if you have any code that references that asset, then the game will not run correctly, so use this feature with care."
