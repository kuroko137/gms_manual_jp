Brush_Builder.htm+html.body.h1:86-3,The Tile Set Brush Builder
Brush_Builder.htm+html.body.p:87-3,"By default when you ""paint"" tiles onto a <a class=""tooltip"" title=""TITLE_KEY::tile_map"">tile map</a> layer in the room editor, you select a single tile and paint with that. However, tile sets are almost always designed to have sections that fit together in different ways to form whole areas or items. For example, an RPG tile set may have landscape feature tiles that can be connected to create larger or smaller features - like trees and buildings - depending on the number of tiles used. Now, placing multiple features like this on a room layer would require you to go back and forth many times to change tile, which is not good for your workflow. To resolve this, GameMaker Studio 2 enables you to create tile <strong>Brushes </strong>in the Tile Set editor, available when you click <img_tag=LMB_Icon:0> on the <strong>Brush Builder</strong> button:"
Brush_Builder.htm+html.body.p.img[alt]:91-6,{IMG_TXT} Brushes
Brush_Builder.htm+html.body.p:91-3,"In the <strong>Brush Builder</strong> you have the original tile set on the left and a blank ""canvas"" on the right. You can now select any tile from the left and paint it on the right to create custom ""brushes"" which you can then use in the room editor. Note that you can click and hold the left mouse button <img_tag=LMB_Icon:1> then drag on the tile set to select multiple tiles to paint into the brush canvas and you can also hold down <img_tag=Control_Icon:0> / <img_tag=CMD_Icon:0> + <img_tag=LMB_Icon:2> to add specific individual tiles or hold down <img_tag=Alt_Icon:0> + <img_tag=LMB_Icon:3> to remove specific tiles."
Brush_Builder.htm+html.body.p:93-3,The following image shows our previously mentioned landscape features as an example of three custom brushes made from a single tile set:
Brush_Builder.htm+html.body.p.img[alt]:94-6,{IMG_TXT} Features As Brushes Example
Brush_Builder.htm+html.body.p:94-3,"On the right you can see three features that we've made (highlighted with an orange box in the image). Notice how we've left a gap of one tile between each feature - this is because <em>any touching group of tiles will be treated as a single brush</em> in the room editor, so we leave a gap of one tile to show that each set is a distinct brush we want to create. While creating your brushes, you paint with the left mouse button <img_tag=LMB_Icon:4> and delete with the right mouse button <img_tag=RMB_Icon:0>. You can also zoom the tile sheet or the brush canvas using <img_tag=Control_Icon:1> / <img_tag=CMD_Icon:1> and the mouse wheel <img_tag=MMB_Icon:0> when the mouse is over one of the windows, or you can pan around using <img_tag=Space_Icon:0> + <img_tag=LMB_Icon:5> or the middle mouse button <img_tag=MMB_Icon:1> and dragging. Note that you can also use the zoom tools in the <strong>Toolbox</strong> within the editor windows to change the zoom levels of either window as well as toggle the grid visibility and colour."
Brush_Builder.htm+html.body.p:100-3,"At the top right you can see the currently selected tool, and you can also set the size of the brush that you want to paint with. The default size is 1, which is a single tile, but if you set it to higher values then you can paint (and erase) with a larger brush composed of the selected tile repeated, as shown in the image below:"

A brief outline of each tool is given below (note that when you have selected a tile layer in the Room Editor, then this toolbox is displayed at the top of the room workspace, along with additional drawing tools):"
