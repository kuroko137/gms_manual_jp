Networking.htm+html.body.p:88-3,"The Networking event is one which will be triggered by any incoming network traffic, and is linked to the <a href=""../../../GameMaker_Language/GML_Reference/Networking/Networking.htm"">Network Functions</a>. This event generates a special <a href=""../../../GameMaker_Language/GML_Reference/Data_Structures/DS_Maps/DS_Maps.htm"">DS Map</a> that is exclusive to this event and is stored in the special variable <a href=""../../../GameMaker_Language/GML_Overview/Variables/Builtin_Global_Variables/async_load.htm"">async_load</a>. This DS map will contain different information depending on the type of network event that generated it."
Networking.htm+html.body.h2:92-3,Common Networking Events
Networking.htm+html.body.p:93-3,"The following keys are common to all received network functions and will always be present in the <span class=""inline"">async_load</span> map:"
Networking.htm+html.body.ul.li:95-5,"""<strong>type</strong>"": This will have one of the constants listed in the table below as its return value, and designates the network event type."
Networking.htm+html.body.ul.li:96-5,"""<strong>id</strong>"": The socket id (a real number, as returned by the network_create_server or network_create_socket function) that is receiving the event. In most cases the socket ID returned is the ID of TCP or UDP socket that triggered the event, however if the event is triggered in a server and it's a Data Event (see below) then the socket ID is that of the client that sent the data."
Networking.htm+html.body.ul.li:98-5,"""<strong>ip</strong>"": The IP address of the socket (as a string)."
Networking.htm+html.body.ul.li:99-5,"""<strong>port</strong>"": The port associated with the IP address (useful when working with UDP)."
Networking.htm+html.body.p:101-3,"The possible return values for the ""type"" key can be any of the four constants listed below:"
Networking.htm+html.body.table.tbody.tr.th:105-9,Constant

Networking.htm+html.body.table.tbody.tr.td:109-9,network_type_connect
Networking.htm+html.body.table.tbody.tr.td:110-9,The event was triggered by a connection.
Networking.htm+html.body.table.tbody.tr.td:113-9,network_type_disconnect
Networking.htm+html.body.table.tbody.tr.td:114-9,The event was triggered by a disconnection.
Networking.htm+html.body.table.tbody.tr.td:117-9,network_type_data
Networking.htm+html.body.table.tbody.tr.td:118-9,The event was triggered by incoming data.

Networking.htm+html.body.ul.li:131-5,"""<strong>socket</strong>"": This key will hold the connecting/disconnecting socket id."
Networking.htm+html.body.p:133-3,"If the event is of the type <span class=""inline"">network_type_non_blocking_connect</span>, then additionally there will be the following key:"
Networking.htm+html.body.ul.li:135-5,"""<strong>succeeded</strong>"": This key will be either 0 or 1, where 0 means the connection timed out and 1 means it succeeded and the socket is ready to use."
Networking.htm+html.body.p:137-3,"It is worth noting that the Networking Event does not get triggered in clients when the server disconnects, and that neither of the <span class=""inline"">network_type_*</span> events will be triggered in clients when the server they are connected to disconnects, even if the connection is TCP based."
Networking.htm+html.body.h2:140-3,Receiving Data
Networking.htm+html.body.p:141-3,"When you have a <span class=""inline"">network_type_data </span>type event, which signifies that your network has received data, the map created will have the following keys:"
Networking.htm+html.body.ul.li:143-5,"""<strong>buffer</strong>"": This is the unique ""buffer ID"" which is generated by the event. A ""grow"" type buffer, byte aligned to 1, is created to hold the ID should be stored in a variable and used for all further function calls to the buffer in this event. Just like the <span class=""inline"">async_load</span> map, the buffer created is automatically removed from memory at the end of this event.
