Introduction_To_GameMaker_Studio_2.htm+html.body.p:93-3,"You can even combine both and mix GML functions with DnD™ actions, giving you a great deal of flexibility when it comes to how you write things. This is all laid out in an intuitive fashion, with different aspects of your game "" <strong>chaining</strong>"" together in the <a class=""tooltip"" title=""TITLE_KEY::IDE"">IDE</a> to give you a unique and very visual representation of the workflow."
Introduction_To_GameMaker_Studio_2.htm+html.body.p:96-3,"GameMaker Studio 2 comes with a number of powerful tools, like a complete <strong>Image Editor</strong> for creating your own <a class=""tooltip"" title=""TITLE_KEY::sprites"">sprites</a> and the ability to use <a class=""tooltip"" title=""TITLE_KEY::tile_sets"">tile sets</a> and you can also import images that you have made in any external editor, including Spine skeleton animations and SWF format vector files. Once you have your images it's simply a question of assigning them to objects in the <strong>Object Editor</strong>, adding some code or DnD™ actions, and then placing instances of these objects into a game room in the <strong>Room Editor</strong>. There are also additional tools for creating <strong>Paths</strong>, <strong>Sequences</strong>, <strong>Shaders </strong>and a whole lot more. You'll find the IDE is also incredibly flexible, and it can be customised to your needs, should the default IDE setup not cover something you require, using the different <a href=""../Setting_Up_And_Version_Information/IDE_Preferences/General_Preferences.htm"">Preferences</a>."
Introduction_To_GameMaker_Studio_2.htm+html.body.p:99-3,"This help file will tell you all you need to know about GameMaker Studio 2 and how you can create your own games with it. However, please realise that even with a program like GameMaker Studio 2, designing computer games is not completely effortless - so no ""make me a MMORPG"" button here! Be aware too that there are many aspects to making games and that they are all equally important: game-play, graphics, sounds, user interaction, etc... But, the most important aspect of all, is patience. While GameMaker Studio 2 is a powerful tool, it cannot do everything for you at the touch of a button so start small with simple examples and you will find that not only is creating games great fun, but that learning to use GameMaker Studio 2 to do it is also very rewarding!"
