Compiling.htm+html.body.p:87-3,"<a class=""tooltip"" title=""TITLE_KEY::Compiling"">Compiling</a> your game can mean one of two things: compiling it for testing, or compiling it to create an <em> <a class=""tooltip"" title=""TITLE_KEY::executable_package"">executable package</a></em> or a specific target platform. Compiling your game for testing can be done by simply pressing the Play button <img_tag=Play_Icon:0> at the top of the IDE, which will launch the game for testing using the specified target. You can also run the game in <strong>Debug Mode</strong> by testing using the Debug button <img_tag=Debug_Icon:0>. This will run the game, but also open up the <strong>Debug Window</strong>, where you can monitor how your game performs and see any issues (see the section on <a href=""Debugging.htm"">Debugging</a> for more information)."
Compiling.htm+html.body.p:91-3,"By default GameMaker Studio 2 will run and debug using the built in <a class=""tooltip"" title=""TITLE_KEY::Virtual_Machine_(VM)"">Virtual Machine (VM)</a>, which is more or less the same as running on the desktop OS being used. However GameMaker Studio 2 is a <strong>cross platform engine</strong> and you can test, debug and compile executable packages of your projects on a number of different target platforms (the exact platforms available will depend on the details of your licence). To change the current target platform you can click <img_tag=Icon_LMB:0> on the Targets button <img_tag=Target_Manager_Icon:0> to open the <strong>Targets Window</strong>, which will look something like this (exact details will vary based on your licence type):"

Compiling.htm+html.body.p:95-3,"At the top, beside the Targets button, you have the current settings which tells you the platform and the specific settings actually being used, and then the rest of the window is taken up with the details and options for all the available targets which you can select to use instead.

To begin with, you will only have a single ""Local"" machine listed here, which is the machine that GameMaker Studio 2 is installed on, but you can also configure a Remote Worker to use. When a Remote Worker has been configured, you will then be able to select it from the list here, and have it build your projects rather than use the host machine where GameMaker Studio 2 is installed."

Compiling.htm+html.body.div.ul.li:117-7,"<strong>VM</strong>: The VM (Virtual Machine) target uses a generic <em>runner </em>for each platform and then interprets the code for your game. In general this option is used for testing due to its faster build times, but it does not offer the same performance boost that using the YYC option (if available) offers. You can use this to compile executable packages for smaller games or games where performance is not ever going to be an issue."
Compiling.htm+html.body.div.ul.li:119-7,"<strong>YYC</strong>: The YYC (YoYo Compiler) takes the normal GameMaker Studio 2 output and compiles it into native code for the target platform, ""stripping out"" unneeded functions and performing a host of other optimisation techniques to create a smaller and performance enhanced executable package. This can increase your games performance by at least two or three times, especially on logic-heavy games, and is ideal for those larger or CPU intensive projects. Compile times may take longer and you should always clear the compiler cache before building any final complete asset package for a target platform. Note that the YYC target may require extra tools to be installed for the platform selected, otherwise it will not work - you can find further information about this from the <a href=""https://help{-dot-}yoyogames{-dot-}com/hc/en-us/articles/227860547-GMS2-Required-SDKs"">YoYo Games Help Center</a> as well as on the individual <a href=""../Setting_Up_And_Version_Information/Platform_Preferences.htm"">target Preferences</a> pages detailed in this manual."

Compiling.htm+html.body.ul.li:159-5,"<strong>Windows </strong>- Compiling for the general Windows OS will first request that you choose between creating an <em>Installer </em>or a <em>Zip </em>package, where the installer will be a single executable that will install your game, and the Zip file will be a single <span class=""inline"">*.zip</span> format compressed file with all your game files stored within (the files will need extracted for the game to run). <img_tag=Windows_Compile_Options:0>If you check the box marked <strong>Remember Packaging Option</strong> then GameMaker Studio 2 will remember the choice for all future compiles (this can be reset or changed from the <a href=""../Setting_Up_And_Version_Information/Platform_Preferences/Windows.htm"">Windows Preferences</a>). You can find out more from the <a href=""https://help{-dot-}yoyogames{-dot-}com/hc/en-us/sections/207157668"">YoYo Games Help Center</a>. Please note that the Windows target can compile 32bit <em>or </em>64bit executables depending on what you have selected in the <a href=""../Settings/Game_Options/Windows.htm"">General Game Options</a>. We <strong>strongly recommend that all new projects use the x64 Runtime to create 64bit executables</strong> as the 32bit runtime will be getting deprecated and removed in the future."
Compiling.htm+html.body.ul.li:164-5,"<strong>Ubuntu (Linux)</strong> - Ubuntu (Linux) apps can be compiled as <span class=""inline"">*.zip</span> files - containing either an x64 or an ARM executable - depending on the device being targeted.

For your game to work you will need both of these to be uploaded to a <a class=""tooltip"" title=""TITLE_KEY::server"">server</a>. The <span class=""inline"">index.html</span> can also be customised to show your game with a different background colour, or at a different position etc... but a knowledge of HTML is necessary for this, and you can also specify your own custom index file when you build the package (see the <a href=""../Settings/Game_Options/HTML5.htm"">HTML5 Game Options</a>).
