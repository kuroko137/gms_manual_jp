Setting_Up_Git_Plugin.htm+html.body.p:87-3,"When starting to use the GIT plugin, we need to setup an identity for GIT to commit as, which means we need to go to the <a href=""../../Setting_Up_And_Version_Information/IDE_Preferences/Plugin_Preferences.htm"">Plugins - Source Control (Git)</a> section of the <a href=""../../Setting_Up_And_Version_Information/IDE_Preferences.htm"">Preferences</a> and add your authentication details."

Setting_Up_Git_Plugin.htm+html.body.p:89-3,"This authentication identity will be used for all future projects, and GameMaker Studio 2 gives you two different ways that you can set it up:"
Setting_Up_Git_Plugin.htm+html.body.ul.li:92-5,"<strong>Username And Password</strong>: Clicking the ""<em>Add New User/Pass Authentication</em>"" button will present you with the following window where you can input the <strong>Repository URL</strong>, the <strong>Username</strong> and the <strong>Password</strong>:<br /> <img_tag=SCM_Username_and_Password:0>If you want this to affect just a specific repository then place the URL for the repository in the top field. However, if it's domain wide authentication you want (ie: ""<span class=""inline"">bitbucket.org</span>"" or ""<span class=""inline"">github.com</span>"" ) then just place the domain and nothing else. When something needs to check for authentication, it will look for a specific repository match first, and then a domain match. This will allow you to have a default authentication for a domain, and override with specific details for certain repositories later."
Setting_Up_Git_Plugin.htm+html.body.p:98-3,"NOTE: If you are using an external repository, then you should be using the username and password associated with the account set up for that repository, but if you are wanting to use a local repository then you can use any username and password."
Setting_Up_Git_Plugin.htm+html.body.ul.li:100-5,"<strong>SSH Keypairs</strong>: Clicking the ""<em>Add New SSH Keypair Authentication</em>"" will present you with the following window where you can input the <strong>Repository URL</strong> and <strong>Password</strong> before giving the paths to the <strong>Public Key</strong> and <strong>Private Key</strong> files required:<br /> <img_tag=SCM_SSH_Settings:0>Like the Username/Password authentications, you can have domain and repository specific authentications when using SSH keypairs. If you already have an SSH Keypair generated, you can set the paths up here, as well as any password required to access them. Note that should you need quick access to the public key, the copy button <img_tag=Icon_SCM_Copy:0> will automatically copy the contents to the clipboard for you. If you don't already have an SSH Keypair, clicking on the <strong>Create KeyPair</strong> button will bring up a file dialog of where to place the private key, and the public key will be created adjacent to it - this will fill out the paths to the public and private keys automatically for you."
Setting_Up_Git_Plugin.htm+html.body.p:106-3,"These settings will now be used to communicate with the repository (IE: Git Hub, Bit Bucket, etc.. ) when handling clone, push and pull requests. However you still need to set up the per-project options which can be done by opening up the <a href=""../../Settings/Game_Options.htm"">Main Options</a> and clicking the <strong>Enable Source Control</strong> option. This will activate SCM for the current project."
