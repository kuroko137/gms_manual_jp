The_Inspector.htm+html.body.p:87-3,"The <strong>Inspector </strong>window is a window that shows all the properties associated with a selected element in the IDE. The window will show information about the element being inspected, as well as all the editable properties for that element and permit you to change them as required, updating the asset that is being inspected to match."
The_Inspector.htm+html.body.p:89-3,"<strong>IMPORTANT!</strong> Currently the Inspector Window is only available for inspecting <a href=""../The_Asset_Editors/Sequences.htm"">Sequence</a> properties, but in future updates it will be expanded to include other assets."
The_Inspector.htm+html.body.p:90-3,"You can open multiple Inspector windows at any time, and each one can be linked to a specific element in the IDE. To ensure that each time you click an element all open inspectors don't change to show the new selection, you must first <strong>lock </strong>the inspector window. To do this, you would open an inspector, select an IDE element to inspect, and then click the lock button on the inspector to to lock it on the element (shown in the image below). Once you have locked the inspector, you can open another one and then repeat the process."
