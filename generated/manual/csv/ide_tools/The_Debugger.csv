The_Debugger.htm+html.body.p:87-3,"The <strong>Debugger </strong>is a powerful tool for checking your game, and is especially useful for tracking down errors and bugs in your code, as well as checking that scripts are run when they should be, and that variables and arrays contain the values you expect etc... You can start the Debugger by running your game from GameMaker Studio 2 <a class=""tooltip"" title=""TITLE_KEY::IDE"">IDE</a> using the Debug button <img alt=""{IMG_TXT} Debug Icon"" class=""icon"" src=""../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_Debug.png"" style=""width: 100%; max-width: 24px;"" /> at the top of the IDE, or by going to the <a href=""../IDE_Navigation/Menus/The_Build_Menu.htm"">Build menu</a> and selecting ""<em>Debug</em>""."
The_Debugger.htm+html.body.p:89-3,<strong>NOTE</strong>: You may be prompted by Windows Firewall (or any other firewall program that you run) to create a security exception for this module. <strong>You must do this otherwise it will not work correctly</strong>. This is due to the way the Debugger works and is essential for debugging mobile platforms.

The_Debugger.htm+html.body.div.p:98-5,"The graph shows the current and average memory use as well as the current and average FPS over time, and you can zoom in or out using the <img alt=""{IMG_TXT} Control Icon"" class=""icon"" src=""../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_Ctrl.png"" style=""width: 100%; max-width: 55px;"" /> / <img alt=""{IMG_TXT} CMD Icon"" class=""icon"" src=""../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_Cmd.png"" style=""width: 100%; max-width: 55px;"" /> along with the mouse wheel <img alt=""{IMG_TXT} MMB Icon"" class=""icon"" src=""../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_MMB.png"" style=""width: 100%; max-width: 21px;"" />, and if you position the mouse cursor over any of the graph elements, it will show you the value for that element at the selected point."
The_Debugger.htm+html.body.div.p:99-5,"The Graph view will also show certain debug events as points along the length of the graph. These events are generated automatically by GameMaker Studio 2 at certain points in the running of a game to show specific important events, but you can also add in your own graph elements using the functions <a href=""../GameMaker_Language/GML_Reference/Debugging/show_debug_message.htm""><span class=""inline"">show_debug_message()</span></a> and <a href=""../GameMaker_Language/GML_Reference/Debugging/debug_event.htm""><span class=""inline"">debug_event()</span></a>.

Normally you would simply use the <strong>Step In</strong> button to do this, but you also have one for stepping <strong>over </strong>code and one for stepping <strong>out </strong>of the code. Stepping over is useful when you have large scripts to run through, as clicking this will run the whole script or code block as a single step and stop on the next line afterwards, while stepping out will take you out of a script (they will run, but all at once) and stop on the next step afterwards when the scope changes."
The_Debugger.htm+html.body.div.p:167-5,"The final icon for <strong>real time updates</strong> permits the debug window to update its data in real time, so you can see how variables change or instances are created and destroyed as it happens.

The_Debugger.htm+html.body.p:187-3,"It is important to note that while the game is running it doesn't update the debug windows with variable values and other details by default, therefore you must first either use the Pause button <img alt=""{IMG_TXT} Pause Debug Icon"" class=""icon"" src=""../assets/Images/Icons/Debug_Pause.png"" style=""width: 100%; max-width: 24px;"" /> in the Debugger to pause the game before Locals, Globals and other data will be available, or enable real-time updating from the icons at the top <img alt=""{IMG_TXT} Real Time Debug Icon"" class=""icon"" src=""../assets/Images/Icons/Debug_RealTime.png"" style=""width: 100%; max-width: 24px;"" />.

The_Debugger.htm+html.body.p:192-3,"Another important part of debugging your game is the use of <strong>Breakpoints</strong>.

The_Debugger.htm+html.body.p:198-3,"Breakpoints set from the IDE are saved along with your project and will persist over various runs until removed again, however if you add a breakpoint to your code in the Debugger, this will be lost after the module is closed, or a new test run started.
