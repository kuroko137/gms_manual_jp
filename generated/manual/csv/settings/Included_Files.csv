What files you add will depend on what you want to do, but things like default <span class=""inline"">*.ini</span> files, sprites and background images, or language text files are commonly used as included files."
Included_Files.htm+html.body.p:90-3,"To add these things to your project there is an editor window that can be opened from the Asset Browser <b>Extras</b> menu <img alt=""{IMG_TXT} Extras Menu Icon"" class=""icon"" src=""../assets/Images/Icons/Icon_AssetMenu.png"" style=""width: 100%; max-width: 21px;"" />:"

Included_Files.htm+html.body.p:96-3,"This window shows the name of the file, its size on disk, and also the platforms that it should be exported to when you compile/test your game.

Included_Files.htm+html.body.p:99-3,"<strong>IMPORTANT!</strong> When including sound files, you should ensure that the files avoid names that clash with streaming sound assets. For example, a sound asset called ""main_music"" and an included file called ""main_music.ogg"" is going to be undefined when the project runs. This is becuase streamed files are also stored outside of the main project bundle, so care must be taken in these situations."
