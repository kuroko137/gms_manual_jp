phy_active.htm+html.body.p:87-3,"This variable controls whether or not the instance is currently ""active"". Setting it to <tt>false</tt> will prevent the instance from participating in the physics world, and setting it to <tt>true</tt> will have it participating again. Please note that this is not the same as <a href=""../../Asset_Management/Instances/Deactivating_Instances/Deactivating_Instances.htm"">deactivating the instance</a>, as the instance is still visible on the screen and can still be changed through code, rather this function just prevents it from participating in the physics simulation"
