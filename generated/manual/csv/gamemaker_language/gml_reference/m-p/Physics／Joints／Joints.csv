Joints.htm+html.body.p:87-3,"In the GameMaker Studio 2 physics world, joints are used to constrain instances to the world or to each other. Typical examples in games include ragdolls, teeters, and pulleys, but joints can be combined in many different ways to create interesting motions or add realism to your game world."
Joints.htm+html.body.p:89-3,"<b>NOTE</b>: A joint does not need to be deleted when you destroy an instance joined to another instance, nor does it need to be deleted at the end of a room. Except in very specific cases (see the <a href=""physics_joint_gear_create.htm"">gear joint</a>) as this is dealt with automatically by GameMaker Studio."
