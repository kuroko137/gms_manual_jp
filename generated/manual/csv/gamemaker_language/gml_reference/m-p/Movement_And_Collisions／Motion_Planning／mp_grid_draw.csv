This function is essential as a debug tool but it should be noted that it is <i>very</i> slow and only works when used in the <b>draw</b> event of the instance, and that you can set the draw alpha to change the opacity of the grid, permitting you to draw it as an overlay and see what is actually in the room at the same time."
