mean.htm+html.body.p:91-3,"This function works by adding up all the input values and then dividing them by their own number. You can have as many arguments as you require (note that more arguments will mean that the function will be slower to parse). So, <tt>mean(2, 6, 9, 32)</tt> returns 12.25 as 2+6+9+32=49 and 49/4=12.25."
