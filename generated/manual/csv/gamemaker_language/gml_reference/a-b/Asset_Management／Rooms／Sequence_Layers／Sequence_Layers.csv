Sequence_Layers.htm+html.body.p:87-3,"In this section we have the functions that are used for adding, removing and editing how <a href=""../../../../../The_Asset_Editors/Sequences.htm"">Sequences</a> behave in a game room in relation to the <i>layer</i> they are on. It should be noted that sequences are similar to objects, in that when one is created on a layer in a room, it is considered an <i>instance</i> of the main sequence <i>object</i> from the <a href=""../../../../../Introduction/The_Asset_Browser.htm"">Asset Browser</a>. So, when you add a sequence to a layer in a room, you are creating an <i>instance</i> of the base sequence object, and this sequence instance is added as an <i>element</i> within a room layer. The sequence instance is what controls things like playback speed and direction, and will itself contain another sequence data <i>struct</i> which is what contains the actual sequence track data. This is important, as the functions listed below will reference the sequence <strong>element ID</strong> (the ID of the sequence <i>on the layer</i>) as well as the sequence <strong>instance ID</strong> (the actual ID of the sequence that is being referenced by the element) and the sequence data <a href=""../../../../GML_Overview/Structs.htm"">struct</a> (which contains all the sequence data)."
