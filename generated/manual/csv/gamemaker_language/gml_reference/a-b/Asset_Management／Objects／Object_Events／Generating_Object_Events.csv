Generating_Object_Events.htm+html.body.p:87-3,"GameMaker Studio 2 is completely event driven, and that all actions happen as the result of certain events that are triggered in a specific order or by a specific occurrence within the game. There are a number of different events, each one with a specific task or timing and some of them are even split into separate ""sub"" events. Normally these events are run by GameMaker Studio 2 when it detects an in-game trigger, or every game tick (as is the case with the step and draw events), but you can also apply an event to an instance in the current room from within a piece of code."
Generating_Object_Events.htm+html.body.p:90-3,The following functions exist that deal with generating events:
Generating_Object_Events.htm+html.body.ul.li:93-5,event_inherited
Generating_Object_Events.htm+html.body.ul.li:94-5,event_perform
Generating_Object_Events.htm+html.body.ul.li:95-5,event_perform_object
Generating_Object_Events.htm+html.body.ul.li:96-5,event_user
Generating_Object_Events.htm+html.body.p:99-3,There are also a number of read only variables that can be used with the functions listed above which are particularly useful for debugging:
