room_speed.htm+html.body.p:87-3,This variable holds the running speed of <b>all</b> rooms (and the game) in game frames per second. Note that this is <i>NOT</i> the FPS (frames per second) but rather the number of game steps that GameMaker Studio 2 will try to maintain each second.
room_speed.htm+html.body.p:89-3,"<b>IMPORTANT!</b> This variable is maintained for Legacy Support only, and should not be used as it no longer sets the speed for a single room, but for ALL rooms in the game. To change game speed you should instead be using the function <span style=""font-size:1px;""><a href=""../../General_Game_Control/game_set_speed.htm""><tt style=""font-size: 14px"">game_set_speed()</tt></a></span>."
