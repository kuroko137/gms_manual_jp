path_positionprevious.htm+html.body.p:87-3,"This variable can be used to get or to set the position of an instance along its current path in the previous step, and is a normalised value between 0 and 1 ie: 0 is the start position of the path and 1 would be the end position. It is similar to the <a href=""../../Instances/Instance_Variables/xprevious.htm""><tt>xprevious</tt></a> and <a href=""../../Instances/Instance_Variables/yprevious.htm""><tt>yprevious</tt></a> variables in how it works, only it is specific for paths. It can be useful for things like temporarily stopping a path follower if something is in the way (see the example code below)."
