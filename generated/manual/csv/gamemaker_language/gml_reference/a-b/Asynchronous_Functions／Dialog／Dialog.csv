Dialog.htm+html.body.p:87-3,"Most modern computers and mobile devices do not like it when a game is stopped while a dialog window is shown. They tend to interpret this as game runner having stopped, and may consider it an error and close the app prematurely. To prevent this GameMaker Studio 2 has <strong>asynchronous</strong> dialog functions that permit you to request certain forms of user feedback or input, but without blocking the game runner at any time, meaning that - when called - the game will run as normal in the background while the user responds to the shown dialog window. Once the user has responded, a <a href=""../../../../The_Asset_Editors/Object_Properties/Async_Events/Dialog.htm"">Dialog Asynchronous Event</a> will be called so that you can deal with the results."
Dialog.htm+html.body.p:90-3,"<strong>NOTE</strong>: This means that if it is possible for the player to lose the game, get killed, etc... while this dialog is being shown, then you should take steps to create a pause system, otherwise it'll be an unpleasant user experience."
