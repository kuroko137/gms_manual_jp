sprite_set_speed.htm+html.body.p:87-3,"This function can be used to set the base animation speed and type as for the sprite resource. This is normally set in the <a href=""../../../../../The_Asset_Editors/Sprites.htm"">Sprite Editor</a>, but there may be moments when you are required to set this manually for a given sprite resource. You need to supply the sprite index to set, the animation speed and the type of animation speed to apply. The animation speed type can be any one of the following constants:"

sprite_set_speed.htm+html.body.p:106-3,Selecting the type of speed to use to calculate animations is very important as there is a huge difference between the two options. The following two examples illustrate this difference:
sprite_set_speed.htm+html.body.ul.li:108-5,If you have a sprite that draws 1 frame per <i>second</i> and set the image speed to 0.5 it will draw at 0.5 frames per second. If your game frame rate is 60 frames per second then the sprite will draw 1 frame for every 120 game frames.
sprite_set_speed.htm+html.body.ul.li:110-5,If you have a sprite that draws 1 frame per <i>game frame</i> and set the image speed to 0.5 it will draw 0.5 frames per game frame. If your game frame rate is 60 frames per second then the sprite will draw 30 frames for every 60 game frames.
sprite_set_speed.htm+html.body.p:113-3,"You can find out what the speed value used for the sprite animation was using the function <a href=""../Sprite_Information/sprite_get_speed.htm""><tt>sprite_get_speed()</tt></a>, and you can get the animation speed type using <a href=""../Sprite_Information/sprite_get_speed_type.htm""><tt>sprite_get_speed_type()</tt></a>."
