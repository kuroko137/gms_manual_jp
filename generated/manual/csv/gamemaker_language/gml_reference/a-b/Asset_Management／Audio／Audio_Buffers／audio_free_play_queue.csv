audio_free_play_queue.htm+html.body.p:87-3,"This function is used to free up the memory associated with the given audio queue. The queue index is the value returned when you created the queue using the function <a href=""audio_create_play_queue.htm""><tt>audio_create_play_queue()</tt></a>, and this function should be called when the queue is no longer required to prevent memory leaks. Freeing the queue will stop any sound that is be playing, and you cannot delete the buffer that a sound is being streamed from until the queue it is assigned to has been freed. This function will trigger an <a href=""../../../../../The_Asset_Editors/Object_Properties/Async_Events/Audio_Playback.htm"">Audio Playback Asynchronous Event</a>, and in this event a special <a href=""../../../Data_Structures/DS_Maps/DS_Maps.htm"">DS map</a> will be created in the variable <a href=""../../../../GML_Overview/Variables/Builtin_Global_Variables/async_load.htm""><tt>async_load</tt></a> with the following key/value pairs:"
