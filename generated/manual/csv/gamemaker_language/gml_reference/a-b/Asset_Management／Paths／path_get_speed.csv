path_get_speed.htm+html.body.p:87-3,"This function returns the speed factor of any given position on a path. The position should be a value between 0 and 1 (you can use <a href=""Path_Variables/path_position.htm""><tt>path_position</tt></a>, for example, if you need the current position of the instance) with 0 being the start position and 1 being the end. The value returned will be the factor by which the actual <tt><a href=""Path_Variables/path_speed.htm"">path_speed</a> </tt>is being set. For example, on a path with only two points, 0 and 1, where the point 0 speed factor is 100 and point 1 speed factor is 0, the function <tt>path_get_speed(path, 0.5)</tt> will return 50."
