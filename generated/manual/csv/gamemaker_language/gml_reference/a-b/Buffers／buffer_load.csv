buffer_load.htm+html.body.p:87-3,"This function will load the buffer data that was previously saved using the <a href=""buffer_save.htm""><tt>buffer_save()</tt></a> functions into a new buffer. This new buffer is created by the function as a ""grow"" buffer (see <a href=""buffer_create.htm"">here</a>) with a byte alignment of 1, and the new buffer id is returned. This ID should be stored in a variable and used in all further function calls to this buffer. If the load fails for whatever reason, the function will return -1 and a message will be shown in the compiler output window saying that the load has failed."
buffer_load.htm+html.body.p:90-3,"<b>NOTE</b>: It's important that you remove any dynamically created resources like this from memory when you no longer need them to prevent memory leaks, so when you are finished with the buffer that you have created you should free it up again using <a href=""buffer_delete.htm""><tt>buffer_delete()</tt></a>."
