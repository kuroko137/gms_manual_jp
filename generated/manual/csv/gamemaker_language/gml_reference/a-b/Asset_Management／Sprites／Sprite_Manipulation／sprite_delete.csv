This is a very important function for those moments when you need to create and change sprites from external sources (like loading a sprite from a file with <span class=""inline""><a href=""sprite_add.htm"">sprite_add()</a></span>, or duplicating a sprite using <span class=""inline""><a href=""sprite_duplicate.htm"">sprite_duplicate()</a></span>) and should always be used to remove those assets that are no longer needed by a game, or to clear an indexed asset from a variable before re-assigning another asset to that variable. <b>This cannot be used to delete sprites that are included in the game as part of the assets in the Asset Browser</b>."
