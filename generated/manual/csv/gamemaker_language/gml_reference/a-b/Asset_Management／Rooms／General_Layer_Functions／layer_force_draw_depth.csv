layer_force_draw_depth.htm+html.body.p:87-3,"This function forces <i>all</i> layers to be drawn at the specified z depth. This <b>does not change the order the layers are rendered in</b> and they'll still be drawn in depth order, it simply changes what z value is used. In general you do not need to worry about this, but if you have layers that have a depth outside of the legal range (-16000 to 16000) then they won't be rendered, so you can force the Z depth to a reasonable value - 0 for example - and they will all be rendered fine. Note that this is generally only for use with legacy projects from previous version of <i>GameMaker</i> where you could have draw depths higher or lower than the permitted layer range."
