buffer_poke.htm+html.body.p:87-3,"With the <a href=""buffer_write.htm""><tt>buffer_write()</tt></a> function, you can write data to the given buffer at the current ""seek"" position, with each piece of data advancing this position by the bytes being written or read. However, it may be necessary for you to change a given piece of data without wanting to change the current seek position, and that's when you would use this function. You simply supply the function with a buffer index, and then the offset position from the buffer start (in bytes) within that buffer to write to, as well as the data type and the value to be written."
