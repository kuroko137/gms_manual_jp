audio_sound_pitch.htm+html.body.p:87-3,"This function can be used to change the pitch of a given sound. The sound can either be one referenced from an index for an individual sound being played which has been stored in a variable when using the <a href=""audio_play_sound.htm""><tt>audio_play_sound()</tt></a> or <a href=""audio_play_sound_at.htm""><tt>audio_play_sound_at()</tt></a> functions, or an actual sound asset from the Asset Browser. If it is an index of a playing sound, then only that instance will be changed, however when using a sound asset from the Asset Browser, all further instances being played of that sound will be changed."
audio_sound_pitch.htm+html.body.p:90-3,"The pitch argument is a <i>pitch multiplier</i>, in that the input value multiplies the current pitch by that amount, so the default value of 1 is no pitch change, while a value of less than 1 will lower the pitch and greater than 1 will raise the pitch. It is best to use small increments for this function as any value under 0 or over 5 may not be audible anyway. It is worth noting that the total pitch change permitted is clamped to (1/256) - 256 octaves, so any value over or under this will not be registered."
audio_sound_pitch.htm+html.body.p:93-3,"<b>NOTE: </b>The clamped value given above is what GameMaker Studio 2 attempts to clamp the range to, but this value is <b>not</b> guaranteed on all target platforms. iOS, for example, clamps to (1/256) - 8, so you may need to experiment on each target platform and have different versions of a sound resource, each one pre-shifted, should you require higher or lower octave values."
