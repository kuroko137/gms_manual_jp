working_directory.htm+html.body.p:87-3,"<tt>Working_directory</tt> can actually return two different values depending on what you are using it for. If you are writing a file to disk, <tt>working_directory</tt> points to the area of local storage that is reserved for your game on the target device (in windows this is ""<span class=""inline"">%LOCALAPPDATA%/gamedir/</span>"" where the ""gamedir"" is the directory with the name of your game). However, when reading from disk, <tt>working_directory</tt> can be <i>either</i> the local storage <i>or</i> the area where the included files are stored."
working_directory.htm+html.body.p:89-3,<b>NOTE</b>: The <tt>working_directory</tt> variable will return the path <b>including</b> the final backslash.
working_directory.htm+html.body.p:90-3,"For example, if you have a default <tt>*.txt</tt> file included with your game and read it into memory using <tt>working_directory</tt>, then that file will be taken from the area where the included files are stored. If you then choose to write that information to a text file using <tt>working_directory</tt>, this will write the file to the target platforms local storage, where it will be read from the next time unless you instruct GameMaker Studio 2 to delete the file, in which case <tt>working_directory</tt> will once more point to the area where the included files are stored."
working_directory.htm+html.body.p:92-3,"It is worth noting that <em>in general</em> you do not need to use this and simply calling the file name (plus any additional path information) is sufficient, for example this:"
working_directory.htm+html.body.p:93-3,"{ANY_CODE} file_text_open_read(working_directory + ""my_file.txt"");"
working_directory.htm+html.body.p:94-3,would be better done as this:
working_directory.htm+html.body.p:95-3,"{ANY_CODE} file_text_open_read(""my_file.txt"");"
working_directory.htm+html.body.p:96-3,"<b>WARNING!</b> This function may not work as you expect due to GameMaker Studio 2 being sandboxed! Please see the section on the <a href=""../../../../Additional_Information/The_File_System.htm"">File System</a> for more information."
