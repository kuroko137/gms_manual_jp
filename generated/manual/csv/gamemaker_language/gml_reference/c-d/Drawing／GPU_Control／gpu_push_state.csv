gpu_push_state.htm+html.body.p:87-3,"With this function you can push the current GPU state onto a stack to be used later. You would generally use this if you want to ""save"" the current GPU state (things like blend mode, alpha writing, culling, etc... will all be pushed to the stack), then draw something with different settings, and then reset the GPU stack to what it was before (by calling <a href=""gpu_pop_state.htm""><tt>gpu_pop_state()</tt></a>)."
