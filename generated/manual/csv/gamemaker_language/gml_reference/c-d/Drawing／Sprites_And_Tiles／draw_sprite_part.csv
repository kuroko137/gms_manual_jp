draw_sprite_part.htm+html.body.p:87-3,"With this function you can draw part of any sprite at a given position within the room. As with <a href=""draw_sprite.htm""><tt>draw_sprite()</tt></a> you can specify a sprite and a sub-image for drawing, then you must give the <i>relative coordinates</i> within the sprite of the area to select for drawing. This means that a left position of 0 and a top position of 0 would be the top left corner of the sprite and all further coordinates should be taken from that position. The image below shows an example of how this works:"
