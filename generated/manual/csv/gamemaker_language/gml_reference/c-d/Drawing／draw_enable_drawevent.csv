draw_enable_drawevent.htm+html.body.p:88-5,"With this function you can choose to enable (<tt>true</tt>) or disable (<tt>false</tt>) the draw event for <b>all instances in the game</b>, thus giving you control over how and when things are draw, useful if you wish to implement a ""frame skip"" technique. Note that this doesn't just prevent instances drawing to the screen, it suppresses the draw event completely meaning that care should be taken since any game logic that is present in that event will not be run either. One important thing to understand about this function is that if you call it right at the start of the game, before the initial frame is rendered (ie: the Create Event of the first object in the first room of the game), then the game window <b>will not be rendered</b>. This could be useful for online projects that require a server which doesn't need to render anything."
