ds_grid_create.htm+html.body.p:87-3,With this function you can create a new DS grid data structure of the specified cell width and height. This function returns an id which must be used in all further functions that deal with this DS grid.
ds_grid_create.htm+html.body.p:88-3,"<b>IMPORTANT!</b> When you create a data structure, the index value to identify it is an integer value starting at 0. This means that data structures of different types can have the <b>same</b> index value, so if in doubt you should be using the <span style=""font-size:1px;""><a href=""../ds_exists.htm""><tt style=""font-size: 14px"">ds_exists()</tt></a></span> function before accessing them. Also note that indices are re-used, so a destroyed data structure index value may be used by a newly created one afterwards."
