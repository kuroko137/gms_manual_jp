Match_Making.htm+html.body.p:87-3,"Matchmaking (multiplayer) for Xbox Live and UWP requires a bit of configuration, partly via a configuration file which defines what network connections you are going to use, and partly via setup of session templates and matchmaking hoppers on the Xbox Developer Portal. GameMaker Studio 2 supports this through the use of the UWP target and permits you to do the following:"
Match_Making.htm+html.body.ul.li:90-5,Create a multiplayer session
Match_Making.htm+html.body.ul.li:91-5,Find (and/or join) a multiplayer session
Match_Making.htm+html.body.ul.li:92-5,"Be notified when relevant players join or leave a session, as well as receive their network connection details"
Match_Making.htm+html.body.ul.li:93-5,Be notified when the session host migrates to a different user
Match_Making.htm+html.body.ul.li:94-5,Get a list of users in the session
Match_Making.htm+html.body.ul.li:95-5,Leave a session
Match_Making.htm+html.body.p:97-3,"Xbox Live network connectivity relies on something called a <b>Secure Device Association</b>, which is basically a contract defining exactly how the device connects to other devices and what sort of data it is able to communicate using that connection. These are configured using a file which you need to include in your project. You can find an example of this file <a href=""http://help{-dot-}yoyogames{-dot-}com/attachments/token/aF6pHTwVLjGal1JOQbV3NpyZg/?name=test_xbox_network_manifest.man"" target=""_blank"">here</a>. The main important points in the file are the protocol and port numbers for each socket description, as these must match what you actually set up in code."
Match_Making.htm+html.body.p:99-3,"Once you have created this network manifest file, it should be added to the project as an <a href=""../../../../Settings/Included_Files.htm"">included file</a>. Then, inside the UWP Game Options, in the Xbox One General tab, it should be selected in the ""Included File for Network Config Manifest"" combo box."
Match_Making.htm+html.body.p:101-3,"To create a multiplayer session, you need to specify what <b>Session Template</b> is going to be used. These session templates are defined on the XDP, but an example is shown below:"
Match_Making.htm+html.body.p:102-3,"{ANY_CODE} Session Name: MatchSession<br /> Contract Version: 107<br /> Session Template (JSON text):<br /> {nbsp_x4}{ <br /> {nbsp_x4}""constants"": {<br /> {nbsp_x8}""system"": {<br /> {nbsp_x12}""version"": 1,<br /> {nbsp_x12}""maxMembersCount"": 12,<br /> {nbsp_x12}""capabilities"": {<br /> {nbsp_x12}}, <br /> {nbsp_x12}""memberInitialization"": {<br /> {nbsp_x16}""externalEvaluation"": false,<br /> {nbsp_x16}""membersNeededToStart"": 1<br /> {nbsp_x16}} <br /> {nbsp_x12}}, <br /> {nbsp_x8}""custom"": {}<br /> {nbsp_x8}} <br /> {nbsp_x4}}"
Match_Making.htm+html.body.p:109-3,"A description of the fields can be found in ""Session Overview"" in the XDK help file. Note that we currently don't support setting session parameters dynamically from GameMaker Studio 2."
Match_Making.htm+html.body.p:110-3,"Along with the session template, a matchmaking hopper must also be set up to allow the session to be found (this is also done on the XDP). Hoppers are used to define rules which are used when matching players. As with session parameters, we don't currently support setting hopper parameters dynamically from GameMaker: Studio. See the ""SmartMatch Matchmaking Configuration"" section in the XDK help file for further details."
Match_Making.htm+html.body.p:112-3,"The following functions are available for XboxLive matchmaking (note that you will also need to use the GameMaker Studio 2 <a href=""../../Networking/Networking.htm"">Networking Functions</a> for the connections etc...):"
