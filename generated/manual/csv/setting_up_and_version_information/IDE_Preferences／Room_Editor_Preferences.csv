Room_Editor_Preferences.htm+html.body.p:88-3,"The <strong>Room Editor Preferences</strong> are used to define how the <a href=""../../The_Asset_Editors/Rooms.htm"">Room Editor</a> will look and behave. The general settings are as follows:"
Room_Editor_Preferences.htm+html.body.ul.li:90-5,<strong>Chain fade out start distance (px)</strong>: Sets the distance from the parent window for the chain link to fade out from. Default is 10px.

Room_Editor_Preferences.htm+html.body.ul.li:93-5,"<strong>Default layer depth spacing</strong>: When you create multiple layers in the room editor they are automatically assigned a depth based on their position within the layer list. This depth is incremented by the amount given here. The default value is 100, so each layer will be previous layer + 100 in depth."
Room_Editor_Preferences.htm+html.body.ul.li:95-5,<strong>Default room width</strong>: Sets the initial width that will be selected as the default for a new room. Default is 1024px.

You can switch that behaviour off here so that new rooms will have no pre-made layers. This is on by default."
Room_Editor_Preferences.htm+html.body.ul.li:99-5,"<strong>Show room views</strong>: If you have views active within a room, this is shown by an outline where the view boundaries would be within the room, and the visibility of this area can be toggled using the dedicated button in the editor itself. However you can choose to have view boundaries invisible when you open a room by un-checking this option (the button can still be used to show them again). The default value is on, making view boundaries visible when you open a room."
Room_Editor_Preferences.htm+html.body.ul.li:101-5,"<strong>General colour options</strong>: These are related to the different colours that are used throughout the room editor interface, and if you double click on any of the swatches you can edit the colour for that setting."
