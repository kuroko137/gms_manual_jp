Image_Editor_Preferences.htm+html.body.p:88-3,"The <strong>Image Editor Preferences</strong> are used to define how the <a href=""../../The_Asset_Editors/Image_Editor.htm"">Image Editor</a> window looks and feels. The following are the general options:"
Image_Editor_Preferences.htm+html.body.ul.li:90-5,"<strong>Expand sprite controls overlay by default</strong>: When this is checked, the sprite controls and frame information will be shown in the Image Editor every time you open a sprite for editing (this can be closed again using the collapse button <img_tag=Collapse_Nodes_Icon:0>, but it will reopen on editing the sprite again later). When this is unchecked, the sprite controls and frame information will be hidden on opening a sprite. The default is to have this unchecked."
Image_Editor_Preferences.htm+html.body.ul.li:93-5,"<strong>Default Loop Mode</strong>: The loop button in the Image Editor can be set to function in two different modes: either play once, where the animation will stop when it gets to the last frame, loop from the start, where the animation will go back to the first frame when it finishes, or ping pong, where the animation will go up through the images to the end and then back down through them again to the beginning. The default value here is ""loop""."
Image_Editor_Preferences.htm+html.body.ul.li:95-5,"<strong>Draw thin selection outline</strong>: If this is checked then the outline for selections will be an absolute 1px in width, regardless of the scale of the image, while having it un-checked will make the selection outline a relative 1px in width and scale with the image. The default is to have this option checked."
