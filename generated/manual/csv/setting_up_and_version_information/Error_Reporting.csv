Error_Reporting.htm+html.body.p:87-3,"While great care has been taken when creating GameMaker Studio 2 to ensure that it is a stable and reliable tool, there is always the possibility that an issue could occur given the nature of the software and the operating systems it runs on. In most cases any errors will be caught by GameMaker Studio 2 and you may be prompted to save your projects and then close and restart the program. If this happens then we would request that you file a bug with the YoYo Games helpdesk. You can do this using the <strong>Report A Bug</strong> option from the <a href=""../IDE_Navigation/Menus/The_Help_Menu.htm"">Help Menu</a> and, we ask that when doing so you give as much information as possible and also supply a link to the GameMaker Studio 2 <span class=""inline"">ui.log</span> file, which can be found in the following locations, depending on the OS:"
